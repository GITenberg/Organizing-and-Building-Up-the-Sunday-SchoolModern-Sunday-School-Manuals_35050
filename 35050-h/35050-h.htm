<h2>PREFATORY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preparation of this volume the purpose
was to supply a convenient handbook upon the
organization, the management, and the recruiting
of the Sunday school, to be read by those desiring
information upon these subjects. But after the
larger part of the work had been prepared a desire
was expressed that the method of treatment be so
modified that the volume might be employed as a
text-book for classes and individual students in the
department of teacher-training. It has been the
aim of the author not to alter the work so materially
as to render it unfitting for the general reader;
and with this in view the series of blackboard outlines
for the teacher, and the questions for the
testing of the student's knowledge, have been
placed at the end of the book. In the hope that
both the reader and the student may receive
profit from these pages the book is committed to
the public.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HISTORIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL MOVEMENT</div>


<p>1. <b>Magnitude of the Sunday-School Movement.</b>
At the opening of the twentieth century the
Sunday school stands forth as one of the largest,
most widely spread, most characteristic, and most
influential institutions of the Anglo-Saxon world.
Wherever the English race is found the Sunday
school is established, in the Mother isle, on the
American continent, at the Cape of Good Hope,
and in Australasia. In the United States and
Canada it has a following of fourteen million members,
representing every religious denomination.
Its periodical literature has a wider circulation
than that of any other modern educational movement.
It touches every class of society, from the
highest to the lowest; and its largest membership
is found among the young, who are of all ages the
most susceptible to formative forces. It is safe to
say that this institution has exerted a powerful
influence upon the majority of the men and women
of to-day, and is now shaping the character of
millions who will be the men and women of to-morrow.</p>

<p>2. <b>A Modern Movement.</b> Great as it appears in
our time, the Sunday school is comparatively a
modern institution. Undoubtedly, the germ of it
can be traced back to that source of all the religious
life of the civilized world, the Hebrew people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The elemental principle of the Sunday school is
possibly to be found in the prophetic guilds before
the Exile, and the schools of the Jewish scribes
after the Restoration. The great Bible class of
Ezra (Neh. 8) was not unlike a modern Sunday
school. Yet as an organized institution the
Sunday school began with Robert Raikes, the
philanthropist of Gloucester, England, who on one
Sunday in 1780 called together a group of street
boys in a room on Sooty Alley, and employed
young women to teach them the rudiments of
reading and religion. If Raikes had not happened
to be the editor of the town newspaper, and in
constant need of copy, his Sunday school might
soon have been forgotten. But from time to time
he published concerning it paragraphs which were
copied into other papers and attracted attention,
so that the Sooty Alley Sunday school became the
parent of a vast progeny throughout the United
Kingdom and beyond the seas. No institution
then in existence, or recorded in church history,
suggested to Robert Raikes either the name or
the plan. Both arose out of his own good heart
and active mind. But since his day both the
name "Sunday school" and its plan of working
have been perpetuated, and every Sunday school
in the world is a monument to Robert Raikes, the
editor of Gloucester.</p>

<p>3. <b>A Lay Movement.</b> It is a significant fact
that the first Sunday school was established not
by a priest, but by a private member of the Church
of England, that its earliest teachers were not
curates, nor sisters, but young women of the
laity, and that throughout its history the movement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
has been directed and carried forward, in
all lands and among nearly all denominations, by
lay workers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This is noteworthy, because in the
eighteenth century, far more than in our time, the
teaching of religion was regarded as the peculiar
function of the clergy, and lay preaching was
frowned upon as irregular. The earliest Sunday
school may have been preserved from churchly
opposition by its own insignificance; or it may
have won the favor of the clergy by the fact that
all its pupils at the close of the morning session
were regularly marched to church. Whatever the
cause may have been, it is certain that under a
providence which we must regard as divine, both
in its beginning and throughout its history, the
Sunday school, although a laymen's movement, has
received favor, and not opposition, from the clergy
and the Church.</p>

<p>4. <b>Unpaid Workers.</b> It has been stated that
Raikes paid the young women who taught in his
Sunday school a penny for each Sunday. But as
the movement went onward the conductors and
teachers were soon giving their service freely; and
this has been the prevailing rule throughout the
world. There are a few Sunday schools wherein a
curate or assistant pastor is the superintendent,
and a few mission schools that employ a salaried
teacher who works through the week as a visitor;
but it may be asserted that the world-wide army
of Sunday-school workers lay upon the altar of
the Church their free-hearted, unpaid offering of
time, study, and effort. This has been and is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
noble, a self-denying, a splendid service; but it
has also been a potent element in the progress of
the movement. Those who would establish a
school, alike in the city and on the frontier, have
not been compelled to wait until funds could be
raised for the salary of a superintendent and
teachers. If only churches rich enough to pay for
workers had established Sunday schools in our
country, the Sunday school as an institution would
not have advanced westward with the wave of
population. And not only has the unpaid service
aided the growth of the movement, it has also
added to its moral and religious power. The pupils
and their parents have recognized that the teachers
were working not for pay, but from love for their
scholars and their Saviour; and that love has
imparted to their message a power all its own.</p>

<p>5. <b>Self-supporting.</b> The Sunday school has been
from the beginning and even now remains in large
measure a self-supporting movement. It everywhere
involves expense for furniture, for teaching
requisites, for song books, for libraries; but for the
most part the money to meet these expenses has
been contributed in the school, among its own
members, and not by the church. Instances are
on record, even, where the church, in former times,
charged and received rent for the use of its property
by the Sunday school! Such short-sighted
practice has been rare, but multitudes of churches
have found the Sunday school a source of far
greater profit than expense. In other words, those
who have done the work of the school have also
paid its bills, and many families that have received
its benefits have been exempt from its burdens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
It is noteworthy, however, that this condition is
passing away, that churches are awakening to their
responsibility and opportunity, and are giving to
the Sunday school that liberal support which its
work requires and deserves. In the ratio of investment
and return, no department of the church
costs so little and rewards so richly as an efficient
Sunday school.</p>

<p>6. <b>Self-governing.</b> As a result of being self-supporting,
the Sunday school has also been a
self-governing institution. Paying its own way
and asking no favor, it has been almost everywhere
an independent body, accepting no outside
authority. It has grown up almost unrecognized
and unnoticed by the churches. Fifty years ago
scarcely one of the denominations, great or small,
gave the Sunday school recognition as an integral
part of its system. Little attention was paid to it
in the ruling body of the local church. It chose
its own officers, obtained its own teachers, made
its own rules, and for its teachings was responsible
to no ecclesiastical authority. It was generally an
ally to, but independent of, the church. In this
respect a gradual change has taken place. Its
relations are now much closer, its position is defined;
and the institution is sanctioned and supervised
by the church.</p>

<p>7. <b>Self-developing.</b> The system of the Sunday
school has been evolved without guidance or control
from any human authority. It has been from
the first self-organizing, and has been also self-developing.
Some might consider the form which
it has taken accidental; but it is better to regard
it as providential. The men and women who laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the foundations of the Sunday school were building
under a divine direction of which they were
unconscious. Working apart from each other, on
both sides of the sea, and separated by wilderness
and prairie, everywhere they established an institution
under the same general principles, and with
substantial unity in its plans. Perhaps one cause
for its unity of method is that it arose in the
midst of the Anglo-Saxon race, a people which
has instinctive tendencies toward law, system, and
organization. If it had started among a Latin
people, where men, and not systems, rule, there
might have been a different form of organization,
with different aims, with different titles for officers,
in every province. But throughout the English-speaking
world, which is the habitat of the Sunday
school, the institution bears the same name. Its
principal or conductor is called a superintendent&mdash;cumbrous
though the title may be&mdash;and its working
force are known as teachers.</p>

<p>8. <b>Bible Study.</b> The most prominent trait in the
Sunday school of the present is that it has become
the most extensive movement for instruction in
the Sacred Scriptures that the world has yet seen.
All these millions of members, young and old, are
engaged in the study of one book&mdash;the Holy Bible.
Many of these millions, indeed, study the Bible
superficially, unintelligently, with narrow interpretations
and crude methods; yet in the Sunday
schools of the lowest type as well as of the highest
some portion of the Bible every week is brought
to the scholars' attention. That the Bible is so
generally known and so widely circulated, that the
demand for this ancient book warrants the printing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of more than ten million copies every year, is
due more to the Sunday school, with all its defects
of method, than to any other institution. This
concentration of attention upon the Bible has
grown gradually in the Sunday school. In the
eighteenth century Sunday school, both of England
and America, religious instruction was only one of
its aims; and it was instruction in the catechism
and forms of worship rather than in the Bible.
But by slow degrees the Bible came more prominently
to the front, until now the Sunday school
is everywhere the school with one text-book. He
who surveys the Sunday school through the inner
eye beholds it on one day in each week covering
the continent with its millions of students, all
face to face with some portion of the great text-book
of religion. The thoughtful observer will
reflect that a people whose children and youth
come into weekly contact with the living word
will not wander far from the path of righteousness.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>The general characteristics of the Sunday school,
as they have gradually developed during its long
history, must be considered in any plan for organizing
and conducting an individual school. The
institution should be studied both ideally and
practically: practically, to ascertain what the
Sunday school has been and is now; yet ideally,
with a view to developing its highest efficiency
and largest usefulness. Such a plan for the
specific Sunday school may be called its constitution.
It is desirable to have the constitution in
written or printed form, but it is not necessary.
There is no more complete system than the government
of Great Britain, yet it has no written
constitution; and Mr. James Bryce has shown us
in America that the instrument known as the
Constitution of the United States by no means
represents our own actual method of government.
In every nation there is an unwritten law, wrought
out of a people's consciousness, which is more
imperative and enduring than any parchment scroll
or printed form.</p>

<p>The general principles to be maintained in
establishing and developing a Sunday school are
the following:</p>

<p>1. <b>Aim.</b> The primary aims of the Sunday school
are religious instruction, character-development,
and effective service. It is not to teach history,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
nor science, nor sociology, but religion; and not
merely to impart a knowledge of religion to the
intellect of its pupils, but, infinitely more important,
to make religion an effective force in the
life of the individual scholar. As a Christian
institution, in the definition given by one of its
greatest leaders,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "The Sunday school is a department
of the Church of Christ, in which the word
of Christ is taught, for the purpose of bringing
souls to Christ, and of building up souls in Christ."
If it be in connection with a Jewish synagogue or
temple&mdash;as are some of the best Sunday schools
or Sabbath schools in our land&mdash;it is for the
purpose of instruction in the faith of the ancient
fathers, and of making their teachings live again
in the men and women of to-day. A true religious
education, such as the Sunday school seeks to
give, will include three aims: (1) knowledge,
(2) character, (3) service. There must be an
intellectual grasping of the truth; a character
built on the truth, out of faith in God, and the
life of God inspiring the human soul; and service
for God and humanity. The Sunday school seeks
to develop not only saints in fellowship with God,
but workers for God, who shall strive to realize
on earth the kingdom of God, not seeking to be
ministered unto but to minister. There have been
centuries in the past when the Christian ideal was
the cloistered saint, living apart in communion with
God. But that was a pitiably incomplete conception
of the perfect man. In our age we have the larger
ideal of saintliness with service; and to promote
this should be the aim of every Sunday school.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>2. <b>Method.</b> To attain its aim the Sunday school
employs the teaching method. The Sunday school
is not, as some weak-minded people have called
it, "the nursery of the church." Nor is it, as it
has been named, "the Bible service"; for, although
it holds a service, it is more than a service. It
is not&mdash;or should not be&mdash;a gathering of groups,
large or small, where silent hearers listen to
sermonettes by little preachers, miscalled teachers.
It holds a service imbued with the spirit of worship,
yet worship is not its central purpose. It
should have music, but it is not primarily a service
of song. It should be pervaded by an atmosphere
of happiness, but mere enjoyment is not its object.
The Sunday school is a <i>school:</i> and the very
word shows that its aim is instruction and character
formation, and its method is that of teaching.
For the work of a Sunday school the essentials
are three:</p>

<p>(1) There must be the living teacher who is
fitted to inspire, to instruct, and to guide. His
part is not merely to pour knowledge into his
pupils, but to awaken thought, to guide the
search for truth, to call forth expression in character
and in action.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>(2) There must also be the scholar who is to
be taught. It is his part in the process of instruction
not merely to listen and to remember, not
merely to receive impressions, but to give expression
to the teaching, in life, in character, in influence,
and in service. The true effectiveness of the
teaching in the Sunday school will be shown by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the reproductive power of the truth in the life
of the scholar.</p>

<p>(3) There must be a text-book in the hands
of both the teacher and the pupil. In any school
for religious instruction one book will of necessity
stand prominent, that great Book of books which
records the divine revelation to man. The Sunday
school may teach history, geography, institutions,
doctrines, literature of the Bible, but these only
as a framework or a foundation for the education
of the heart into a personal fellowship with God.
This character-molding, faith-impelling force is the
divine truth taught in the Bible through the
experiences and teachings of patriarchs, prophets,
priests, psalmists, sages, and apostles, and above
all by the words and life and redemptive work of
the Master himself. And the subjects of study in
the Sunday school need not be limited to the
text of Scripture. There may be extra-biblical
material for the teaching of character and service;
and all this should be open to the Sunday school.</p>

<p>3. <b>Relation to the Church.</b> However independent
of the church organization the Sunday school may
have been in its beginnings, and however self-dependent
some union Sunday schools may of necessity
be in certain churchless regions, the general fact
is established that the Sunday school as an institution
belongs to the church, is under the care of
the church, has a claim upon moral and financial
support by the church, should be a feeder to the
membership of the church, and should gratefully accept
the supervision of the church. It should regard
itself and be recognized by all as in many ways
the most important department of the church.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>Government.</b> All power must be under direction,
and the mighty energies of the Sunday
school especially need a wise, strong guidance.
In the general management of the Sunday school
two elements should be recognized: (1) the rights
of the workers and (2) the authority of the church.</p>

<p>(1) It must ever be kept in mind that the
Sunday school is an army of volunteers. Its
workers are men and women who of their own
accord give to the school without compensation
their gift of service. Those who make such a
contribution to the success of the Sunday school
should certainly have a voice in its management.</p>

<p>(2) But it is not to be forgotten, on the other
side, that the Sunday school is not superior to the
church, nor independent of it, but subsidiary to
it; hence the church should be able to exercise
some control over the school if such control shall
ever be needed. For example, in the choice of a
superintendent, who is the executive officer of the
school, the ruling body of the local church and
the working body of teachers and officers should
unite. No one should undertake to conduct a
church Sunday school unless he thus has the
definite assurance that his teachers are with him,
and that his church is officially supporting him.</p>

<p>5. <b>Officers.</b> Little need be said here on this
subject, for it is one with which every worker is
familiar.</p>

<p>(1) There must be a leader, or manager, the
executive head of the school, who is universally
styled the superintendent. If we were organizing
a new institution, and not describing one already
world-wide and with officers already named by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
common usage and consent, we would prefer that
the executive of the Sunday school receive the
title of Principal or Director; but the somewhat
awkward word Superintendent is settled upon him,
and will remain.</p>

<p>(2) There must also be an assistant superintendent,
or more than one, as the size of the
school may demand. The better title is associate
superintendent, as is now given in the larger
number of well-organized schools. The superintendent
should have the privilege of nominating
his own associates or assistants, the nominations
to be confirmed by the board of teachers and
officers.</p>

<p>(3) There will be a secretary, with such assistants
as he may require, to be nominated by the
secretary and confirmed by the teachers.</p>

<p>(4) There will be a treasurer, to care for the
funds, and to disburse them as ordered by the
board of teachers, or the Sunday school as a whole.</p>

<p>(5) Lastly, but most important of all, there must
be the working force of instructors, the faculty of
the institution, its teachers, who should be carefully
chosen. The pastor, as well as the superintendent,
should have an active voice in their call,
since they are his coworkers in the religious
instruction of the congregation.</p>

<p>6. <b>Membership.</b> In the conception of a Sunday
school, both ideal and practical, the constituency
for which it is established must be considered.
As has been noted, it was originally for children
only, and only for children who were destitute of
home training, and outside of church relationship.
The earliest Sunday schools were what are called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in England ragged schools, and in America mission
schools. But in the noble evolution of the movement
the Sunday school constituency has been
vastly enlarged; and now it is recognized that the
Sunday school is for all ages and all classes. It
should embrace the young and old, the ignorant
and intelligent, the poor and rich, the sinner as
well as the saint. The Sunday school which fulfills
its mission to society will welcome all the world.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NECESSITY AND ESSENTIALS OF A GRADED SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>1. <b>The Necessity of Grading.</b> As the result of
the gradual and unguided evolution of the Sunday
school through a century or longer, most schools
are now divided in a vague way into certain
departments, generally known as the Primary, or
Infant Class; the Youths Department, or Boys
and Girls; and the Adult Department, or Bible
Classes. Many who have charge of schools such
as these regard them as graded, and so report
them. But the mere naming of departments does
not constitute a graded school. Whoever studies
the ungraded or loosely graded Sunday school will
perceive in it certain evils which can be removed
only by a thorough system of grading, maintained
faithfully through a series of years. Some of these
conditions which make the graded Sunday school
an absolute necessity are the following:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The School as a Whole.</i> The close observer,
looking at the entire school, notes first of all that
its gains and its losses in membership are at the
extremes of its constituency. It is the normal
condition for the gains to come in the Primary
section; for the little children in families are
attracted to the school or brought there by older
children. There is almost invariably a constant
increase in this department, requiring frequently
the organization of new classes in the grade above,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
among the younger boys and girls. But, on the
other hand, there is a constant loss of older scholars.
In most schools, at the age of fourteen, in what
is known as the early adolescent period of life,
the pupils, for one reason or another, begin to
drop out, and few enter to take their places.
Almost every school is thus growing at the bottom
and dying at the top. The Primary classes are
full, but the classes of those above fourteen years
are usually small&mdash;two large boys here, three
yonder. And although girls continue in the school
more frequently than boys, there will appear the
same conditions&mdash;some large classes of girls and
young women, but others where discouraged
teachers are sitting down with one, two, or three
pupils. Six or eight years ago these same classes
came out from the Primary Department, each
with eight or ten pupils; now they are mere
skeleton classes, barely alive, and threatened with
dissolution. Every earnest, thoughtful superintendent
would rejoice to find some plan that will
guarantee large classes of young people between
sixteen and eighteen years of age, for this is the
most vital period in the life of the individual.
Such a plan is proposed in the graded system.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Condition of the Classes.</i> Fixing the
attention upon the several classes, the critic of the
school system notes three unfavorable conditions:</p>

<p>(a) There is the inequality in the size of classes,
to which reference has already been made. When
classes come together by accident, pupils bringing
their friends, or new members joining whatever
classes they please, some classes of boys or girls
will inevitably be too large for good government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
or good teaching, and others will be too small
to create any enthusiasm, either in the teacher or
the pupils.</p>

<p>(b) There is also an inequality in the ages of
pupils in the same class. A class may include
one pupil or two pupils sixteen years old, and
others as young as ten, or even nine years; some
who during the week are in the high school, and
others who can scarcely read the verses assigned
to them.</p>

<p>(c) Where these inequalities of numbers and
ages exist there is a lack of that class spirit which
is an essential element of power in a well-ordered
Sunday school. Every class should be a unit,
with a strong social bond; but this ideal cannot
be realized when there are in the class two or
three youths in the noisy, assertive, self-conscious
stage of early adolescence, and others who are
several years younger. Nor can there be a proper
social bond in a class with only two or three
members. They are likely to be irregular in
attendance, to find excuses for absence or for
leaving the school, until at last the discouraged
teacher and the listless scholars together drop out
of sight.</p>

<p>For the correction of these evils of inequality in
numbers and in ages, and of this lack of class
spirit, the only successful method is to grade the
school, and resolutely to keep it graded.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Difficulties of Administration.</i> The difficulties
which confront the superintendent in the
management of an ungraded school are many and
great.</p>

<p>(a) The first and ever-present difficulty is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
obtaining teachers for new classes. The constant
growth of the Primary Department is his perennial
perplexity. To relieve the congestion in the
crowded Infant Class its older pupils must be
brought into the main school, and teachers must
be found for them. The superintendent is always
seeking, and often seeking vainly, for new teachers.</p>

<p>(b) Another difficulty is found in the attempt
to transfer scholars from one class to another.
No matter how much out of place a pupil may be,
it is almost impossible to transfer him to another
class without incurring the displeasure of the
teacher, the scholar, or the scholar's family. And
however overgrown or ill-assorted a class may
have become, to divide it is a delicate task, almost
sure to cause ill feeling. Also, when there arises
the need of a teacher for a new class just emerging
from the Primary Department, the natural
plan would be to combine some of the skeleton
classes in the other departments, and thereby release
a teacher for service with the new class.
But the superintendent who attempts this plan
finds that almost invariably it results in some of
the older scholars leaving the school because their
teacher is taken from them.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Essentials of a Graded School.</b> Briefly
stated, the essentials of a graded Sunday school
are the following:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>(1) <i>Departments.</i> The graded Sunday school is
organized in certain distinct groups, of which the
most important, for our present purpose, are the
Primary, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior Departments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
To these will be added the Beginners and
Adult Departments when the subject comes up
for a complete treatment. Each of these departments
should have, if possible, a separate room;
but if these rooms cannot be provided in the
building, the pupils should be seated by departments
in the different parts of the one room.
Perhaps it may be assumed that there is a separate
room for the Primary Department; then let those
who have most recently come from the Primary
be seated on the right block of seats; the Youths
or Intermediate in the middle; and the Senior
classes on the left block, or vice versa. The
younger classes of the department should have
the front seats, the older those in the rear, in
regular gradation. The school may be arranged in
the order shown in this diagram:</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-029.jpg" width="500" height="386" alt="diagram" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Classes.</i> The number of classes should be
fixed for each department, and their relationship
established, so that when a group of scholars is
promoted to a higher grade in the same department,
or in the next department, they do not
enter as classes, but as individuals; not to form
new classes in the department, but to be placed
in classes already formed. This plan will keep
the classes in the Senior Department always full,
and avoid the unfortunate skeleton classes of the
ungraded school. It will also impress upon the
pupils the importance of faithful work.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Promotions.</i> There should be annual and
simultaneous promotions throughout the school.
One Sunday in the year should be set apart as
Promotion Sunday; and on that day all promotions
should be made. Those who are to be
advanced from the Intermediate to the Senior
Department are called out by name and placed
in their classes, which are not new classes, but old
classes replenished with new members. These promotions
will vacate the seats of the Fourth Year
classes in the Intermediate Department. But these
seats will at once be filled by the Third Year now
becoming the Fourth Year, and taking their seats;
the Second Year pupils becoming the Third Year;
and the First Year the Second Year. The First
Year of the Intermediate Department will be left
vacant, to be filled by promotion of the Fourth
Year in the Junior Department, and the moving
up of classes to the year above in the same department;
and the First Year of the Junior Department
will be filled by promotion from the Primary
Department.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) <i>Teachers.</i> As groups of scholars pass either
from one grade or from one department to another
there must also be a change of teachers. This
constitutes the crux of the entire system, and in
its inception is apt to prove the most formidable
obstacle in grading the school. The pupils, however,
are accustomed to a system of promotions
in the day school, and expect to leave their
teachers when they change their grades; but many
of the teachers in the Sunday school, not being
trained under the system, dislike to lose their
scholars, and show their dissatisfaction in ways
that affect their pupils. This difficulty must be
overcome by tact and an appeal to unselfish
motives; teachers must consent for the sake of
the common good to give up their old classes and
take new ones which begin in the department.
The teacher may remain in the grade and receive
a new class each year as his pupils advance to a
higher grade; or he may remain with the class and
advance until the pupils pass from their former
department to a higher one, as from Primary to
Junior, from Junior to Intermediate, and from
Intermediate to Senior. He should then return to
a new first year's class in his own department and
lead it through the course. If any teacher asks,
"Why cannot I go with my class into the Senior
Department?" the answer is that if the plan be
permitted for one it must be recognized for all;
and in the Senior Department there will follow
an increasing number of classes, with a relatively
diminishing membership in each class. The scholars
also need the inspiration of contact with different
teachers. Furthermore, the teacher who is adapted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the Junior or Intermediate Department is rarely
a suitable teacher for Senior scholars. Hence
there is need of a careful assignment of teachers
no less than of pupils. Therefore, to maintain a
graded school the pupils must change teachers
when they change departments.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Lessons.</i> There should be graded lessons
for each department. If a graded system be
followed in the school, as it should be, with different
subjects, text-books, and lessons for each
department, giving to the entire school a regular,
systematic, progressive curriculum, this requisite
will be met. If, however, the uniform lesson for
all the school be followed, as at present is still
the case in many Sunday schools, the graded
teaching must be given in the form of supplemental
lessons, taught by the head of the department
where it has a separate room, or by the teacher
if the departments must be assembled in one
room. In some form the graded teaching is an
absolutely essential requisite of the graded school.
Most schools, when once thoroughly graded, will
realize the need of the next step in the evolution
of the institution&mdash;lessons graded in subjects as
well as in methods for the several departments.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Basis of Promotion.</i> The question is often
asked, "Should promotions be made on the basis
of age, or as the result of examinations?" The
examination system may be regarded as desirable
in the Sunday school, but there are as yet few
schools where thorough examinations can be rigidly
insisted on as a part of the school system, and
promotions invariably made to depend upon standing.
A school which meets only once a week,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for a session of less than an hour and a half, and
with but one lesson period of forty minutes or
even less, cannot maintain the same strictness in
its standards as the public school. Moreover, new
scholars are continually entering the schools, and,
while most of them begin at the foot of the ladder
in the Primary Department, yet others enter at
various ages and in various grades. Any system
of promotion based merely upon acquirement
attested by examination is sure to become in
many instances a meaningless form when applied
to the Sunday school. Yet acquirements and
examinations need not be ignored in the graded
Sunday school. There may be certain ages at
which the pupils shall by right pass from a lower
grade to a higher. But it may also be arranged
that pupils who are exceptionally bright, well-informed,
and studious can be promoted a year
in advance of their classmates by passing examination.
Let the examination be given in writing
to all the pupils, and let all be urged to take it;
with the promise that those who pass will be
promoted, even though they be less than the
required age. But let it also be understood that
failure to pass the examination will not keep the
student for more than one year from promotion.
In other words, the examination may well be
made the door through which earnest students
may pass on, and so keep abreast of their equals
in training and ability.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GRADING OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>The question is often asked, "How may an
ungraded Sunday school be placed on a graded
basis?" The work may seem simple, and easy of
accomplishment, but when it is undertaken difficulties
arise which must be intelligently and tactfully
met.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Difficulties.</b> If all our Sunday-school
teachers were trained educators, accustomed to the
methods of the public school, they would see at
once the advantages of the graded system, and
heartily enter into it. But most of our teachers
are untrained, and their range of vision often fails
to reach beyond their own class and their immediate
environment. The relation between teachers
and scholars is personal rather than official; and
on both sides the personal equation often complicates
the problem. In every school there are a
few teachers who are so strongly influenced by
their feeling for their pupils that they fail to
recognize the needs of the school. There are also
scholars, especially in the sentimental early adolescent
age, who are unwilling to leave their teachers
when promotion is offered to them. But unless
the change of teachers is maintained the graded
system will utterly fail to benefit the school;
it will be graded in name only, and not in
fact. This part of the program must be carried
through, even though it may cost the school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the loss of a teacher or two teachers and their
scholars.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Remedy</b> for this difficulty is only to be
found in carefully considered action by presenting
the necessity and value of the plan so clearly that
the teachers as a whole will fully understand it,
appreciate its importance, and heartily accept it.
The grading should not be attempted upon the
mere fiat of the superintendent, nor on the vote
of a bare majority of the workers. The teachers
must recognize the self-sacrifice which it requires,
and must make that self-sacrifice generously, giving
up their scholars for the general good. The possible
objections of the scholars are more easily overcome,
for they are accustomed in the public
schools to promotions with change of teachers,
and readily accommodate themselves to the same
system in the Sunday school. Thoughtfulness and
kindness, with time, will soon remove the hindrances
from the path of the graded school.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Method of Grading.</b> The school may be
graded in either of two ways, the gradual or the
simultaneous method.</p>

<p>(1) In the gradual method the superintendent,
with the concurrence of the teachers, may announce
that after a certain date all promotions
will be made in accordance with the graded system,
leaving the classes as they are until the time for
promotion arrives. Then promote from Primary to
Junior, from Junior to Intermediate, and from
Intermediate to Senior, according to the principles
of the graded school; and in four or five years,
if the system be maintained, the result will be a
school fully graded in all its departments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) In the simultaneous method of grading, the
plan must be carefully matured, and general
co&ouml;peration of all assured. The following plan has
been tested in more than one school, and found
to work successfully:</p>

<p>(a) Let a careful committee be chosen to arrange
the details of grading. The committee should
consist of teachers acquainted with the scholars
as far as may be practicable, and should, of course,
include the superintendent. They should also take
an abundance of time for their work.</p>

<p>(b) Obtain the ages of all the scholars between
eight and eighteen years of age, and, approximatively,
the ages up to thirty. Let this list be
made quietly by each teacher for his or her own
class. It may be desirable not to inform the pupils
for what purpose the enrollment is made. Instances
have been known where scholars have
understated their ages, hoping thereby to remain
with favorite teachers.</p>

<p>(c) Let the committee go over the lists and
assign the scholars to classes according to age and
acquirement. In some degree social relations
should be considered, so that each class may be
as far as practicable a social unit. In the Intermediate
Department boys and girls should be in
separate classes, and not more than six or eight
pupils should be placed in one class. No announcement
of the assignment of scholars to classes
should be made until the day fixed for the reorganization
of the school. It will be a good plan to
prepare a map or chart of the schoolroom, with
the place proposed for each class indicated upon it.</p>

<p>(d) On the day appointed, after the opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
exercises, first let the seats or rooms set apart
for the Senior Department be vacated; and then
let the roll be called according to the new list.
"Class No. 1, Senior Department. Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;,
with the following scholars." As their names are
called let them take their places, until the list
of classes and scholars in this department is filled.
Next vacate the seats assigned to the Intermediate
Department, and let these teachers and pupils
take their places; then the Junior Department,
according to the same plan. The Primary Department
can be graded by its superintendent or
teacher without aid from the committee.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that every scholar must
take the place assigned to him at the time when
his name is called; and that only for an important
reason can an assignment, when once made, be
changed. In a large school there will be found
a few cases where the committee has made a mistake,
even with the greatest care; and these mistakes
should be rectified, but not until the pupils
have taken their new places temporarily in the
scheme of the school.</p>

<p>4. <b>Advantages of Thorough Grading.</b> Many
benefits will follow from the proper organization
of the school; and their value will be increasingly
apparent as the system is maintained through a
series of years.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Appearance.</i> It is the testimony of every
superintendent and pastor who has graded his
Sunday school that the appearance of the school
is greatly improved by the graded system. The
older scholars are assembled in one body, instead
of being scattered throughout the room; scholars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the same size and age are brought together in
classes. The school will also actually seem larger
than it was before the grading.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Order.</i> The order of the school will be
more easily maintained. The big boys and the
giggling girls, both at the self-conscious, awkward
age, will be in a new environment, no longer the
leaders over smaller and younger pupils, but in
classes by themselves, and with responsibilities
appealing to their self-respect.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Social Relations.</i> It will be a benefit to
the scholars of each age to be associated in groups
of the same period in life, with the same interests
and similar mental acquirements. Many scholars
will find their new associations more congenial
than their former ones in the ungraded classes,
where older and younger people have been brought
together. The class will now become, far more
than it was before, a social power.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Teaching Work.</i> In the ungraded class, with
older and younger pupils together, the teacher
met with his greatest difficulty in finding a common
ground of interest. In the graded class, with
pupils of uniform age and equal intellectual understanding,
the teaching can be better adapted to
the needs of the pupils.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Incentive to Interest.</i> The prospect of promotion
awakens an interest in the classes. Each
scholar looks forward to the time when he will
attain to a higher grade with its enlarged privileges.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Obtaining Teachers.</i> The grading of the
school greatly aids in the solution of the ever-present
problem of obtaining new teachers, (a) The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
graded school requires a smaller number of teachers
than the ungraded school, since it provides for
the consolidation of skeleton classes in the Senior
Department. This sets at liberty a number of
experienced teachers for service in other grades.
(b) Whenever a new class comes from the Primary
Department, a teacher is already at hand in the
Junior Department whose class at the same time
has advanced to the Intermediate Department.
The teacher goes year by year with his class until
it leaves the department, and then he returns to
a new class beginning the studies of the same
department. (c) After the results of a teacher-training
class are available there will always be
trained teachers waiting for classes.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Leakage Period.</i> The young people between
fifteen and twenty years of age constitute the
"leakage period,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> when they are in great danger
of drifting away from the school. They will be
held to the school far more firmly if they have
before them the prospect of membership in large
classes of young people, with social opportunities,
and club life, so popular with youth at the early
adolescent age. It has been clearly shown by
practical experience that an organized Senior
Department, with large classes kept full by regular
reinforcement from the Intermediate Department,
will maintain itself and hold its members, while
skeleton classes of the young people constantly
tend to disintegration.</p>

<p>The well-organized, completely graded Sunday
school possesses such evident and great advantages
that it is certain to be established wherever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thorough and efficient religious instruction is
sought. The sooner it comes, and the more
faithfully it is maintained, the better it will be
for the church of to-day and to-morrow, and the
more quickly and effectually will the grave problems
of our modern civilization be solved.</p>

to a graded Sunday school, whether large or
small, have already been named by anticipation.
But it is necessary to give to the subject a closer
consideration, and to add the names of other
departments which are needed either as departments
or subdivisions in the school. Following the
analogy of the secular schools, the great divisions
of a Sunday school may be named as Elementary,
Secondary, and Advanced or Adult. The Elementary
Division will include the Cradle Roll, Beginners,
Primary, and Junior, taking the scholar up
to twelve years of age. The Secondary Division
will include the Intermediate and Senior Departments,
also the Teacher-training Class, and will
embrace the scholars between twelve and twenty
years of age. The Advanced or Adult Division
will include all the classes wherein the average age
is above twenty years, including the Home Department.
Beginning with the youngest children, the
departments of a thoroughly organized school are
the following:</p>

<p>1. <b>The Cradle Roll.</b><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This should include all the
little ones in the families of the congregation who
are too young to attend the school. Their names,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in large lettering, in plain print rather than script,
should be recorded upon a list, framed and hung
upon the wall in the Primary room. A separate
card catalogue should be kept of the names alphabetically
arranged, with ages, birthdays, parents'
names, and the street address of each family.
Every effort should be made to keep the list
complete; children should inform their teachers of
new little brothers and sisters for the Cradle Roll;
the pastor in his visitation should take their
names and report them; and the teacher or conductor
in charge of the Cradle Roll should occasionally
visit every family on the list. Whenever
gifts are made to the pupils of the school, as at
Christmas or on birthdays, toys and dolls for the
little ones of the Cradle Roll should not be forgotten.
In a small school the care of the roll and
the visiting of the families may be assigned to the
Primary superintendent; but in a large Sunday
school it will call for a special conductor, and
recognition as a separate department. Let no
one suppose that this is an unimportant, sentimental
matter. The Cradle Roll, maintained as
it should be, will awaken interest in every
family having a name inscribed upon it, and
in due time will lead many little feet to the
Sunday school.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Beginners Department.</b> At about three
years of age the little children should be brought
to the school, and be regularly enrolled as attending
members, their names being now taken from
the Cradle Roll. They should remain in the
Beginners Department from the age of three to
that of six years&mdash;the Kindergarten period in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
public school. Here they should be told simple
Bible and nature stories, without effort to place
the stories in chronological order; for children of
this age have only a faint conception of the sequence
of events. They may be taught simple
songs, marching exercises, etc. It is a mistake,
however, to give them much, if any lessons, to
tax the memory, beyond a few short sentences of
the Bible and verses of children's songs. If they
can meet in a room by themselves, with their own
teacher, it will be better than to have them in
the Primary room; for the work in this grade
should be constantly varied, and the stories very
brief, in order not to weary the little ones. If
they must meet in the room with the Primary
children, they should sit by themselves as a
separate section, and not with their older brothers
and sisters.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Primary Department.</b> This department
should be the home of little children between
six and eight or nine years of age. They should
remain in it until in the day school they have
begun to read. Boys and girls may be placed in
the same classes, which should be for those six
years old, seven years old, and eight years old,
respectively. With each year their seats should
be changed, indicating their promotion from the
lower to the higher classes. In this department
the simpler stories of the Bible and other helpful
stories adapted to the grade should not only be
told but taught, and the children expected not
only to learn but also to tell them. The Twenty-third
Psalm, the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments,
a few other selected passages of Scripture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and some standard hymns of the Church should
be memorized.</p>

<p>In many well-organized Sunday schools both
the Cradle Roll and the Beginners class are recognized
as subdivisions of the Primary Department,
and are under the direction of the Primary
superintendent.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Junior Department.</b> This department will
care for the children from the ages of eight or
nine until the full age of twelve; except that boys
or girls who are especially advanced in intelligence
may be promoted upon examination at eleven
years. In a very small Sunday school all the
pupils of this department may form one class,
provided they can have a room by themselves.
If they must meet with the rest of the school,
they may be organized either in two classes, one
of boys, the other of girls. If, however, the number
of scholars will admit, it is far better to place
the pupils in separate classes for boys and girls,
with different classes for each year of the period.
To scholars of the Junior grade the great characters
and events of Bible history should be
taught in their order; also the most important
facts about the Bible, and in a simple form the
lands and localities of the Bible. In churches
which use a catechism this should constitute a
part of the teaching in the Junior Department,
for at this period the child's verbal memory attains
its greatest strength.</p>

<p>5. <b>The Intermediate Department.</b> Here the
pupils are from twelve to sixteen years of age.
The classes should be small, generally of six boys
or girls, never more than eight. This period in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
life is known as early adolescence, and calls for
careful direction by wise teachers. In the Intermediate
Department the great biographies of the
Bible should be studied, either as the regular or
the supplemental lessons; also the heroic lives of
leaders in the history of the Church, of foreign
missionaries, and of men and women who have
labored in the home fields. Boys and girls in
this stage of life are instinctively hero-worshipers,
and before them should be set high ideals of
character and service. Special effort should be
made in leading the scholars to personal consecration
to Christ and to union with the Church; for
if the great decision be not made before the age
of sixteen is reached, there is great danger that
it will never be reached. But that decision should
include more than a formal profession. It should
embrace a full surrender to the will of Christ, an
inward, conscious spiritual life, an aim for completeness
of Christian character, and especially a
willingness to work for God and humanity. Youth
is a season of ardor and of energy, a period of
lofty ideals and noble endeavor. All those active
powers of the youthful nature should be guided
into channels of usefulness. The true twentieth
century disciple of Christ is not one who lives
alone feasting his soul on God, but one who stands
among his fellow-men, eager to aid in the world's
betterment.</p>

<p>6. <b>The Senior Department.</b> This is the preferable
title, although some organized schools call it the
Young People's Department, and restrict the word
Senior to the classes of fully adult age. Still
others call it the Assembly, and give it an organization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
independent of the Sunday school.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
age of entrance should be sixteen, except with
some who in stature and mind are mature beyond
their years. It is imperative, as we have already
seen, that at the door of this department the
young people should leave their former teachers,
and should not form new Senior classes, but as
individuals enter classes already established. This
department includes the members of the school
between sixteen and twenty years of age; not that
members of classes must necessarily leave them at
twenty, but that men or women above that age
entering the school should rather join the Adult
Department. The classes may be as large as the
arrangement of rooms will allow; larger where each
class can have a separate room, which is the ideal
plan. Generally, young men and young women
should be in separate classes. The teacher of a
young men's class should be a man whose character
will inspire the respect and win the fellowship of
his class. The teacher of the young women's class
will generally be a lady, although often men have
been successful teachers of young women.</p>

<p>In this department the classes should be organized,
each with its own officers, chosen by the
members; and the class should be consulted when
a teacher is to be appointed, although the voice
of the class in the decision should be advisory and
not mandatory. Especial attention should be given
to the social activities of this department. Each
class should have its own gatherings, classes of
young men and women should meet together
occasionally, and a Senior Reception should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
held at least annually to promote acquaintance
among the members. The interest of the young
people should also be enlisted in some definite
form of service for the church or the community.</p>

<p>7. <b>The Teacher-Training Department.</b> The most
promising young people, both men and women,
should be selected at sixteen years of age&mdash;the
time of promotion into the Senior Department&mdash;and
should be organized as the Teacher-training or
Normal Class. The best teacher obtainable should
be assigned to this department. Often in the
high school or some near-by college, a scholarly,
Bible-loving instructor may be found who is willing
to give a part of his time to the equipment of
teachers for the coming generation. A text-book
should be chosen from among those approved by
the International Teacher-training Committee. No
person should be admitted to this class who is
not willing to give some time during the week to
the study of the course. While the rest of the
school may be studying the regular lessons,
whether graded or uniform, this class should be
at work with the teacher-training text-books.
There should be thorough instruction with examinations
looking toward a certificate of work done, such
as the International Teacher-training diploma.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The course may cover two, three, or four years;
and new members may be placed in the class at
the opening of each year, to begin at the point
where the class is studying, and to remain until
they shall have completed the entire course. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a properly graded school after a few years there
will be a class graduating from and a class entering
the Teacher-training Department each year.</p>

<p>This department should also include a Reserve
Class, consisting of those who are ready to act as
substitutes for absent teachers. If the uniform
lessons are followed, the Reserve Class should study
the lesson a week in advance of the school. Into
this class the graduates of the Teacher-training
Class should be placed, to remain until classes are
ready for them in the school.</p>

<p>In some schools the Teacher-training and Reserve
Classes do not form a separate department,
but are two classes in the Senior Department.
But it is the better plan in a large school to establish
the Teacher-training Department, with its own
officers, thereby adding to its prestige in the school.</p>

<p>8. <b>The Adult Department.</b> This will include all
who are above the age of twenty years. It is the
judgment of advanced leaders in Sunday-school
work that at twenty years those who have belonged
to Young People's classes in the Senior
Department should leave them for the Adult
Department. Otherwise, the Senior Department
in a few years will cease to be a place where young
people of sixteen and eighteen years feel at home.
In the Adult Department men and women may
meet together as members of the same class, unless
there arise a demand for separate classes and the
numbers enrolled justify the division. In conducting
these classes two forms of instruction have
been found to be successful: (1) the colloquial
method of teaching, the class studying and discussing
the lesson together under the guidance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the leader; and (2) the lecture method, the teacher
being the principal speaker, but always admitting
questions and answers on the subject suggested by
the lesson. Classes in this department may be
allowed to choose their own courses of study,
provided (1) that the subjects and methods are
in line with the general aim of religious education,
and not merely secular science or history; (2) that
the courses of successive years have some sequence,
and are not chosen in a haphazard, accidental
manner. The Adult Department under wise direction
should promote a large, intelligent, broad-minded,
philanthropic type of Christian character
in the church and the community.</p>

<p>9. <b>The Home Department.</b> This department, like
the Cradle Roll at the other extreme of the Sunday-school
constituency, is composed of people, both
young and old, who cannot be present at its sessions,
but are interested in its work, and willing
to give some time to its studies. In every community
there are such people&mdash;aged or infirm men
and women, invalids, mothers unable to leave their
offspring, commercial travelers, and people who live
too far from the school to attend it. These are
organized into the Home Department, furnished
with the literature of the school, study its text-books,
make their report of work done, and send
their contributions to its support through the Home
Department superintendent or visitor.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SUPERINTENDENT</div>


<p>1. <b>His Importance.</b> Several years ago, the
president of the New York Central Railway was
called upon by a legislative committee to explain
the system of signals employed upon the railroad
for the protection of passengers. He gave a detailed
statement, answered every question, and
then made this remark: "However perfect the
system may seem to be, there must always be a
man to work it; and in the final analysis more
depends on the man than on the plan."</p>

<p>That which is true in every human organization
is especially true in the Sunday school: its success
depends not on a constitution, whether written or
unwritten, but upon a man. In the Sunday
school that man is the superintendent, who not
only works the plan, but also generally plans the
work. Given an efficient superintendent, an efficient
school will usually be developed; for the able
man will call forth or will train up able workers.
Hence the first and greatest requisite for a successful
Sunday school is that the right man be chosen as
superintendent.</p>

<p>2. <b>His Appointment.</b> The selection of the superintendent
should be the task not only of the
officers and teachers in the Sunday school, but of
the entire church, for every family in the congregation
has an interest in his appointment. The
pastor should be consulted, and should give diligent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
attention and time to the search for a superintendent,
not merely because he may be presumed to
know his constituency, but more especially because
out of all the church the superintendent is to be his
most important helper. The election of the superintendent
should be made by the workers in the
school, its board of teachers and officers, and its
action should be formally confirmed by the ruling
board of the local church. No man should hold
the office of a superintendent who fails to receive
the approval of the church of which the school is a
part. He should know that in his appointment the
school, the church, and the pastor all unite.</p>

<p>3. <b>His Term of Office.</b> He should be chosen
for a term of one year; but may be re&euml;lected for
as many terms as appear expedient. Frequent
changes in the management of the school will
tend to destroy the efficiency of its work. But
whenever the great interests involved in the religious
education of an entire church or community
require a new superintendent the change should be
made, even though sympathy be felt for the one
set aside. The institution must not be sacrificed
to save the feelings of the man.</p>

<p>4. <b>His Qualifications.</b> It is important to consider
the qualifications of an ideal superintendent,
remembering, however, that all these qualities are
rarely to be found in one man. We must set
before us high ideals, not expecting that they will
always be fully realized, yet ever seeking to attain
them as far as may be possible in this imperfect
world. The following are the most important
qualifications for a superintendent; some of them
are essential, all are desirable:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) <i>Moral Character.</i> The Sunday school undertakes
to train the young in character; therefore
he who stands as its responsible head must possess
a character worthy of admiration and imitation.
His life must honor, and not dishonor, his profession.
It is possible for a man whose work for
an hour on Sunday is in behalf of the gospel so
to live in his family, in business, and in society
as to work for six days against the gospel, and
more than undo all his efforts for good. The
leader in such an uplifting movement as the Sunday
school must have clean hands and a pure heart.
What Saint Paul wrote of a bishop he would have
written of a Sunday school superintendent: he
must have "a good report." In the well-known
painting of the Emancipation Proclamation may be
seen standing at the right hand of President
Lincoln the Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P.
Chase, who once said, "A man in my position
must not only seem right, but be right; and not
only be right, but seem right." So will every
one say of the Sunday-school superintendent.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A Devout Believer.</i> The superintendent's
character should be irradiated with the fine glow
of a Christian faith. He should be one who has
seen the heavenly vision and unto it has not
been disobedient; one whose spirit has been kindled
by the Divine Spirit burning like a fire within;
one who is himself a Christian man, longing to
lead other men into fellowship with the Father
through Jesus Christ the Son.</p>

<p>(3) <i>A Working Church Member.</i> We have already
learned that the Sunday school is not a
society or an institution standing alone. It is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
branch of the church, and one of the most important
branches. The normal growth of the church
depends in large measure upon the Sunday school,
and the support of the Sunday school comes, or
should come, from the church. The superintendent
who endeavors to do his duty to his scholars will
strive to lead them to Christ and into active
membership and service in the church. Therefore,
he himself must be a professed, loyal, and effective
member of the church. His name should not only
stand upon its roll, but his heart should also be
enlisted in its behalf.</p>

<p>(4) <i>A Bible Student.</i> The Sunday school is the
school with one pre&euml;minent text-book; and of that
Book the superintendent should be a diligent
student. His work is executive and not instructional;
yet he must supervise the teaching, and
this supervision he cannot rightly give unless he
is familiar with the course of study. He should
study the lesson of each department, perhaps not
as thoroughly as the teachers in the department,
but sufficiently to maintain acquaintance with their
work. And he should master not only the specific
lessons of the immediate course before his school,
but also the Book as a whole.</p>

<p>One successful superintendent gave as a secret
of his power to make his school, both teachers
and scholars, willing to do whatever he asked,
"I never expect my teachers or scholars to do
anything that I am not ready to do myself. Before
I ask them to bring their Bibles I bring mine.
When I asked my school to be ready on the following
Sunday to repeat in concert the Nineteenth
Psalm, I committed it to memory during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
week, and when the time came spoke the words
with the school." Only that superintendent who
himself loves the Bible, and studies it, can have
a true Bible school.</p>

<p>(5) <i>An Able Executive.</i> The Sunday school is
like that vision seen by the prophet Ezekiel, a
system of wheels within wheels, all endowed with
life; and the master of the mechanism directing
its motion is the superintendent. Moreover, each
of these living wheels in the Sunday-school machine
is a volunteer worker, who may at any moment
drop out of his orbit. To hold together these
varied elements, to combine their movements, to
guide each in his own sphere, to compass the
common purpose through all the forces working
as one, requires a wise brain and a skillful hand.
The superintendent should have a plan for the
school, with details throughout for every emergency;
he should be ready to assign to every
worker the task for which he is best fitted; he
should be able to work with others, not merely
to command others; and he should be a leader
whom others will follow, not by the might of an
overmastering will, but by the magnetism of an
attractive personality. He should never forget that
with others as well as with himself service in the
Sunday school is not compulsory but voluntary,
that his associates lay on the altar their free-hearted,
unpaid labor; and that such workers
cannot be commanded, although by tact and wise
generalship they may be led to accomplish the
most difficult tasks.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Sympathy with Youth.</i> The superintendent's
office will bring him into relations with youth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
during all its stages, from early childhood through
the entire adolescent period. He must be able to
see life and the world through the eyes of a little
child, of a growing boy, and of a young man.
The sympathy which he needs is not a compassionate
feeling <i>for</i> youth, but a feeling <i>with</i> youth,
an ability to put himself in its place; to feel as
young people feel, and to understand why they
act as they sometimes do. This sympathy will
impart a love for young people, such a love as
will enable him to be patient with their foibles
and faults, to exert a powerful influence over them,
and to keep before them noble ideals of character
and service.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Teachable Spirit.</i> No matter how much the
superintendent knows, or thinks he knows, he
should hold his mind open to new knowledge.
He should be on the alert for new ideas, from the
periodicals, from books, and from his fellow
workers, in conversation, at conventions and institutes;
not that he may inflict every new method
upon his school, but that out of many methods
he may select the best. When Michael Angelo was
past eighty-five years old, and almost blind, he
was found one day beside an antique torso which
had recently been dug out of the ground, bending
over it, and carefully pressing his fingers upon its
surface. When asked what he was doing, he
answered, "I am learning"! The masters in every
department of work are never too wise nor too
old to learn.</p>

<p>If a man can be found who possesses all these
seven traits of character and temperament, the
school which can secure him for its superintendent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
will be fortunate indeed. And the superintendent
who thoughtfully reads the catalogue of qualifications,
and feels that in some of them he is lacking,
may by divine grace and his own will working
together make progress toward the goal of becoming
an ideal superintendent.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SUPERINTENDENT'S DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</div>


<p>The superintendent has been found, has been
chosen, and is in his place&mdash;what are the prerogatives
and the duties of his office? These may be
considered under three classes: (1) His general
duties. (2) His duties during the week. (3) His
duties in the session of the school.</p>

<p>1. <b>General.</b> (1) <i>Supervision.</i> It is his right to
supervise and direct the work of the school without
interference as to details from the teachers, the
officers of the church, or the pastor. The pastor
may be the admiral of the fleet, directing the
general movements of the sea campaign; but the
superintendent is the captain of the ship, through
whom orders are to be given to all on board.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Selection of Teachers.</i> He should have the
chief word in the choice and appointment of
teachers, but in the choice he should obtain the
concurrence of his pastor; and their election should
be made upon the superintendent's nomination by
the teachers and officers.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Assignment of Scholars.</i> He should possess
the final authority in the assignment of scholars
to classes, in any changes from class to class, and
in promotions from lower to higher departments.
In these responsibilities he may be greatly aided
by an associate superintendent, to whom his
authority may be delegated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) <i>Program of Services.</i> It is the superintendent's
prerogative to plan and direct the
services of the school session. It may be the part
of wisdom for him to consult with the musical
director or organist in the selection of hymns, but
it is the superintendent's right to choose and to
announce them, in common with all parts of the
program.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Support.</i> He is entitled to a loyal support
from all his fellow workers; but if he is tactful he
will take them into his confidence, will present
his plans for their consideration, and will not
attempt important reforms or changes without
their concurrence.</p>

<p>2. <b>Week-day Work.</b> He is the superintendent of
the Sunday school for seven days in every week;
and will find much work to be done between the
sessions. His week-day duties will include some
that have already been mentioned.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Program.</i> Before he comes to the school he
should invariably prepare a well worked out program
for each session. It is a good plan to have
a large blank book, in which two pages opposite
each other are assigned to the session for the day.
Every hymn should be selected in advance and
noted in its place; every announcement to be made
should be written; the outline of a lesson review,
if one is to be given, should be indicated; and
space should be left for memoranda of miscellaneous
matters which may need attention. This
program should be laid upon the desk, so that if
for any reason the superintendent should be out
of his place upon the platform an associate can
go forward without delay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Lesson Study.</i> In schools where the uniform
lesson is still followed in all or most departments,
the superintendent should make himself thoroughly
acquainted with the lesson for the coming session.
As has been intimated, he should be prepared for
any work expected of his teachers and scholars.
He should be ready after the class study to give
a practical summary of the teachings in the lesson,
in a crisp, well-outlined talk, which will be aided
by a blackboard illustration. And in the increasing
number of schools which are employing graded
lessons, not uniform in the departments, the
superintendent should have at least a general
knowledge of the subjects studied in each department.
The more thoroughly the superintendent
fills his own mind and heart with the truth, the
more efficiently will the truth be taught in his
school.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Social Duties.</i> The superintendent should
know all his teachers, and, as far as possible, his
scholars also. If it be practicable for him to visit
teachers at their homes, the visitation will greatly
increase his influence and his usefulness. If in his
own home, or in the parlors of some family in
the congregation, a social gathering of the teachers
and officers can occasionally be held, it will add
to the social power of the school. And in the
social relations much can be accomplished before
and after the church service, the school session, the
prayer meeting, and the other gatherings of the
congregation. There are superintendents who keep
before them up-to-date lists of the classes, and by
study of faces during the school session, with
judicious inquiry, are able to call large numbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the scholars by name. Such greetings will
strengthen the superintendent and heighten the
loyalty of the school.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Seeking Workers.</i> In nearly all Sunday
schools there is a constant need of helpers, to fill
the places of withdrawing or absent teachers; and
the work of supplying the demand generally falls
upon the superintendent. He may find relief in
the work of an associate superintendent, as will
be seen in the next chapter. Both the superintendent
and his associate should always be on the
alert for new teachers and for new scholars. As
the builder in stone looks at every fragment of
rock, to see where it will best fit into his wall,
so the whole-hearted superintendent studies every
individual in the parish, to find exactly the place
he may fill in the school, as an officer, a teacher,
or a scholar; and not infrequently his search will
be rewarded by a treasure.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Cabinet Meetings.</i> The superintendent should
confer frequently with the several heads of departments,
and with all the officers; talking with them
freely about his own plans, and learning theirs,
for the welfare of the school. It is not necessary
that these cabinet meetings should be formal, having
a secretary and a record. They may be held
occasionally, for a few minutes after the session
of the school, or as a social evening at a private
house.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Special Days.</i> He should keep a calendar of
special occasions in the school year, such as the
Sundays set apart for temperance and for missions,
Easter, Children's Day, Rally Day, Decision Day,
Christmas, Promotion Day, and other notable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
events. Weeks in advance of each occasion&mdash;in the
case of some of them even months in advance&mdash;he
should begin to consider what special exercises
should be held, what preparation is needed, and
who can best supervise the plans. For a fortnight
before Children's Day or the Christmas celebration,
many Sunday schools are in a turmoil of confusion,
and lessons abandoned, simply because the
superintendent did not take thought in sufficient
time.</p>

<p>(7) <i>The Convention.</i> The Sunday-school work of
the Christian world is now thoroughly organized
in international, state, county, and town associations.
Each school finds itself a part in a mighty
movement; and it is the duty of the superintendent
to see that his school takes its place in the Sunday-school
army. He should see that in the institute
and the convention his school is well represented;
and if at all possible he should attend these gatherings,
and be active in them. Many a worker who
for most of the year is alone, burdened with
perplexities, has been refreshed, has found his
vision enlarged and his plans improved, by conference
with other workers, and by listening to
experienced specialists.</p>

<p>3. <b>His Duties in the School Session.</b> (1) <i>Present
Early.</i> He should be at his post, if possible,
from twenty minutes to half an hour before the
opening of the school. However early he may
arrive, he will probably find a group of children
there in advance of him; and they will behave
better if his eye is on them, especially if his glance
is kind, and with it is a hand-shake or a word of
recognition. The early superintendent will often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
be surprised to find how much business in the
interest of the school can be transacted before the
session.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Open Promptly.</i> With his program ready,
he should begin the session exactly on the minute,
and should carry out every item according to the
plan. If for any reason the superintendent is not
at the desk when the moment for the opening
arrives, the associate or first department superintendent
should be empowered to call the school to
order and begin the opening service.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Conduct Program.</i> The superintendent
should conduct the general program of services;
although it is advisable to recognize the associate
and others, by calling upon them to take some
part in the opening or closing services. A superintendent
whose methods were always well chosen
was wont once in each month to invite some
official or prominent member of the church, who
was not an attendant upon the school, to be
present, sit upon the platform, and offer the prayer
at the opening of the session. This kept the
leading members of the church in closer relation
to the school.</p>

<p>(4) <i>During the Lesson.</i> As a general principle,
the superintendent should remain at his desk
during the lesson period; but to this rule frequent
exceptions will be made. The supply of substitutes
for absent teachers, and the assignment of
new scholars to classes, belong to the field of the
associate superintendent.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Lesson Review.</i> In the Sunday schools
which still follow the uniform system of lessons,
studying the same portion of Scripture in all, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
nearly all, the grades of the school, the superintendent
should give a brief practical summing up
of the practical points in the lesson; but this
review should not exceed five or six minutes in
length. If the pastor possesses the gift of terse,
crisp speaking, this practical talk may be given
by him. In the schools adopting the graded courses
of lessons this review should be given in each
department by the department superintendent.
Here again the adaptation to the point of view
and needs of the pupils of each grade can be
made much more effective than in the ungraded
school.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Closing.</i> The superintendent should so carry
out the program as to close the session at the
time appointed. An hour and a quarter is as
long as is profitable for the school; and everything
that needs to be done can be brought into
that space. Often much time is lost by unnecessary
delays between the numbers on the program.</p>

<p>4. <b>Miscellaneous Duties.</b> Here are a few general
suggestions, hints, and "don'ts" for the superintendent,
briefly stated:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Notebook.</i> Let the superintendent remember
to obtain that notebook, to keep it at hand,
and to make use of it. Some pages at the end of
the book might be reserved for special suggestions
gathered from books, periodicals, and meetings.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Quiet.</i> Let him be careful not to make much
noise during the session, but to set an example&mdash;which
will soon be felt&mdash;in favor of quiet and
orderly conduct. It is not at all certain that he
needs a bell for calling attention; but if he uses
one, let it be a little, gentle, quiet bell, held in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hand as a signal, and never rung vociferously or
repeatedly. Said a new superintendent as he tested
the bell on Saturday before assuming office, "What
a magnificent bell this would be for calling missionaries
home from India!" But he never used
it in the school. One of the best superintendents
of a generation ago was widely known as "the
silent superintendent." He was not deaf nor
dumb, but his manner was noticeably quiet, and
his large Sunday school was always in perfect order.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Early Lesson.</i> Let the opening service be
short, so that the lesson period&mdash;which is the
important part of the program&mdash;may be reached
while the teachers and scholars are fresh and the
air of the room is pure.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Use the Bible.</i> If a Scripture lesson is read
by the superintendent and school responsively, it
should be from the Bible upon the desk or in
the hand of the leader, and not from a lesson
quarterly. Encourage the use of the Bible as a
text-book and for reference. If the superintendent
always brings his own Bible, he can appeal to his
teachers and scholars to follow his example. With
regard to the Scripture reading in the opening
service, it is the judgment of many thoughtful
superintendents that even in a school following
uniform lessons the reading should not be the
lesson for the day, but a devotional portion of
Scripture, perhaps a selection from the Home
Readings of the week. It is a good plan for the
first reading of the lesson for the day to be by the
teacher and the class together.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Lesson Period.</i> No interruption should be
allowed to break into the time assigned for class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
study, except under imperative necessity. The
teacher and the class should hold that period
sacred to united study, without being diverted
from their task by secretary, librarian, superintendent,
or pastor. Said Bishop Vincent once,
"I would like to have suspended from the roof of
the Sunday-school hall a series of great glass half-globes,
one for each class, to be dropped down
over the class, and kept there during the time
reserved for the study of the lesson!"</p>

<p>(6) <i>Speakers.</i> A visitor should rarely be invited
or allowed to address the school; never, unless the
superintendent has sufficient knowledge to be sure
that he will speak briefly, interestingly, and pointedly.
Before the uniform lesson concentrated the
studies of the Sunday school it was the custom
to invite almost any visitor to speak to the school;
and many were the wrongs inflicted upon the boys
and girls in those good old days by dull, loquacious
Sunday-school orators. But almost everybody
now understands that the Sunday school is
a working institution, and its work must not be
interrupted.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Self-control.</i> There will be times when the
superintendent will need to be on guard over
himself; times when he feels depressed, or melancholy,
perhaps a little cross. If he yields to his
natural impulses, the school will soon perceive the
state of his nerves, and some scholars may even
endeavor to add to his trials. At such times, let
him watch over himself mightily, and resolve, no
matter how he feels, to "keep sweet," to speak
gently, and to look cheerful.</p>

<p>(8) <i>The Aim.</i> Lastly, one purpose should ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stand before the superintendent, and should be the
constant object of his endeavor&mdash;to lead all his
scholars into a personal, vital relation to Jesus as
the Christ, to bring them into union with the
church, and to inspire them to enter upon active
Christian service.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ASSOCIATE AND DEPARTMENT SUPERINTENDENTS</div>


<p>1. <b>The Necessity.</b> In every Sunday school there
is need of an officer to aid the superintendent
and to take his place when absent. Even in a
small school the supervision can be more thorough
and the teaching more efficient, if some one is at
hand with authority to relieve the superintendent
of minor details, and give him freedom for the
general management. And in a large school
assistants to the superintendent are an absolute
necessity, for each department becomes in itself a
school. There is need, therefore, of a general
assistant to be the chief of staff to the superintendent,
and, in a large and well-organized school,
of a special assistant in each department.</p>

<p>2. <b>Titles.</b> Until recently, the assistant superintendent
in most Sunday schools was merely one
of the teachers named to take the place of the
superintendent when absent, but with no duties
when the head of the school was present. In the
complete organization that is now becoming general,
the office has been renamed, and its functions
distinctly assigned. The chief assistant to the
superintendent is now generally called the Associate
Superintendent, a higher title for his important and
regular duties. The chief of each department in
the Sunday school is generally called Department
Superintendent, that is, Primary Department<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Superintendent, Senior Department Superintendent;
and each department superintendent has the
same relation to his department that the associate
superintendent holds to the school.</p>

<p>3. <b>Appointment.</b> The associate superintendent
should be nominated by the superintendent and
confirmed by the board of teachers and officers.
When two candidates are nominated for the office
of superintendent, and one obtains a majority, it
is not wise to elect the minority candidate as
associate superintendent, unless he is entirely
acceptable to the newly chosen superintendent.
The chief executive of the school should not be
compelled to find next to him a rival, who may
be an uncongenial worker, to carry out plans
with which the latter may not be in accord. In
order to possess freedom in his policy the superintendent
should choose his own chief helper; but he
should receive the confirmation of his choice from
his fellow workers in the school. The same plan
of nomination and confirmation should be followed
in the choice of the department superintendents.
The associate and the department superintendents
should constitute the superintendent's cabinet, to
be called together often for consultation upon the
interests of the school.</p>

<p>4. <b>Duties of the Associate Superintendent.</b> (1)
<i>Not a Teacher.</i> Unless the school be small, with
less than a hundred members, the associate superintendent
should not at the same time be the regular
teacher of a class. He will find other work to
occupy his time, both before and during the session
of the school. He may, however, hold himself
ready to act as substitute for an absent teacher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Deputy Superintendent.</i> If for any reason
the superintendent is absent, his place should be
taken promptly by the associate superintendent.
It should also be understood that if at the moment
of opening the school, or at any point in the
general service, the superintendent is not on the
platform, the associate shall act as his representative,
without the slightest reflection upon the
superintendent's administration, the two being regarded
in their work as one.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Providing Substitutes.</i> One definite duty of
the associate superintendent should be to provide
substitutes for absent teachers, relieving entirely
the superintendent from that burdensome and
perplexing task. The teachers should permit no
ordinary hindrance to keep them from their classes,
for no one can fully supply the place of a true
teacher in the regard of the scholars. But when
a teacher finds it necessary to be absent he should
make strenuous endeavor to find a substitute; and
if unable to secure one, should notify, not the
superintendent, but the associate; and before the
lesson period the associate should have a supply
ready.</p>

<p>If the school has been properly graded it will
include a Teacher-training Class; but under no
circumstances should the associate take one of its
members as a supply teacher, even for one Sunday.
This class should remain untouched by the demand
for teachers until its members have completed the
prescribed course. If there is a Reserve Class,
substitutes should be called from it in some order,
preferably alphabetical, so that the same members
will not be taken too frequently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the Sunday school is held in the afternoon
or at noon, the associate can generally provide
for needy classes by watching at the morning
service for possible teachers. If he is compelled
to look for them in the Adult or Senior classes of
the school, he should be present early, and if
possible obtain his supplies before the opening of
the school. If the associate superintendent has
done his work, when the lesson begins, every class
will have a teacher seated before it, ready for the
Bible study. He should never wait until the time
for opening the lesson to see what classes need
teachers, and then undertake to obtain them by
interrupting the teaching in three or four classes
and calling for volunteers, while the classes without
teachers are listlessly waiting, and valuable time is
lost from the half-hour of the lesson period. All
this work should be done before the lesson, and,
if possible, before the opening of the school.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Assignment of New Scholars.</i> Another duty
of the associate superintendent is to meet new
scholars and assign them to classes. For this
work he should be present early, meet the scholars
as they come, learn who the new scholars are,
write down names, places of residence, ages, parents'
names, why they come; and prepare material
for the card catalogue under the secretary's care.
Scholars bringing new members, and teachers into
whose classes they may come, should introduce
them to the associate superintendent, who should
at once take charge of them. No new scholar
below the grade of Senior should choose his own
class, although his desire to be with friends should
be considered, so far as it will not interfere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with the established system of classification. Some
large graded schools have a temporary class to
which new pupils in the Intermediate and Junior
grades are assigned for a few sessions until their
permanent place can be fixed.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Detailed Supervision.</i> There are also minor
duties wherein the associate superintendent can be
of great service. While the superintendent is at
the desk directing the general exercises, his associate
may be upon the floor, quietly observing the
condition and needs of the school. He can note
where Bibles, song books, or lesson quarterlies are
needed, and can see that they are distributed
without interrupting the service. He can also give
quiet attention to the order of the school, calling
to their duty boisterous, talking, or inattentive
scholars. For the superintendent to stop in
announcing a hymn or reading the Scripture, to
rebuke some disorderly or thoughtless pupil, breaks
into the service and mars its dignity. The associate
superintendent can accomplish the desired
result at the right moment by a light step and a
gentle word.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Chief of Staff.</i> In a word, the associate
superintendent should be the chief of staff to the
executive head of the school, his eyes, ears, and
hand; possessing full acquaintance and accord with
his plans, and carrying them out in his name;
informing and advising him, yet careful of criticism;
avoiding all that would hinder, and aiding in all
that would make his management successful. He
can divide the labor, and relieve his chief of some
of the most perplexing and trying details, leaving
him free to watch over the general interests of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
school. Whoever can fulfill such a service is an
invaluable worker, and should be held in high
honor.</p>

<p>Many of the duties named above may be in the
sphere of the department superintendent, who
should be in his section what the associate superintendent
is to the school.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<h2>IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SECRETARY OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>1. <b>Importance.</b> The secretary of the Sunday
school is an officer of far greater importance than
is generally supposed. In too many schools some
youth in the adolescent period is made secretary,
merely to keep him in the school, without consideration
of his capacity and adaptedness to the
office. As a result of an unsuitable appointment,
the minutes of the teachers' meetings are incomplete,
the registry of the classes is neglected, and
the true condition of the school cannot be ascertained.
If by any good fortune or by a more
careful choice an able and faithful secretary takes
his place, at once a new impulse is felt by the
school. The superintendent, the teachers, and even
the scholars will realize that energy, accuracy, and
thoroughness count for much in the work of this
department. They will appreciate faithful service,
and will themselves respond to its influence.</p>

<p>2. <b>Qualifications.</b> The ideal secretary of a Sunday
school should possess the following characteristics:</p>

<p>(1) <i>A Business Man.</i> He should possess the
instincts of a man of business, being willing to
work, systematic in method, and thorough in care
of details.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Regular in Attendance.</i> He should make the
Sunday school his business on Sunday, with a
fidelity equal to that which he manifests toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
his vocation through the week. His regularity
should also embrace promptness, coming in advance
of the hour; for much of the secretary's work may
be done before the opening of the service.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Good Writer.</i> He should be able to write
legibly, and possess skill in framing sentences
correctly, and in writing them plainly, without
unnecessary flourishes.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Quick Mental Action.</i> His mental processes
should be sufficiently rapid for him to set down
an ordinary motion, presented in a public meeting,
without requiring it to be repeated or written out
by the mover. An able recorder will promptly
express in the minutes the form of a motion or
the spirit of a speech, thereby saving much time
in the meeting and much space in the report.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Quiet Manner.</i> The secretary should watch
the program and do his work without interrupting
it. He should never appear among the classes during
prayer, during the reading of Scripture, or
while a speaker is addressing the school. Only
under urgent necessity should he come to a class
in the lesson period, and in that case only at its
beginning. During intervals in the service, or
during the singing, he may find it needful at
times to pass among the classes; but he should
do this necessary work quietly, without distracting
the attention of the school.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Courteous Conduct.</i> His bearing should always
be that of a gentleman, refined and courteous,
thoughtful of others and patient toward all; a
manner enabling him to win the friendly aid of
every teacher, upon whom the accuracy of the
class record must depend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever can be found, in the school or the
community, possessing these qualities, or approaching
them, should be chosen as secretary of the
Sunday school, whether man or woman. Often a
young woman, accustomed through the week to
business methods, becomes an efficient secretary of
the Sunday school.</p>

<p>3. <b>Appointment.</b> The secretary should be elected
by the board of officers and teachers. As he is
not merely an assistant to the superintendent,
but an officer of the school, it is not necessary
that he should receive a nomination from the
superintendent. His term of office should be one
year, with as many re&euml;lections as will promote
the good of the service.</p>

<p>4. <b>Assistants.</b> In almost any school the secretary
will need an assistant, whom he should
nominate, subject to confirmation by the board of
teachers and officers.</p>

<p>5. <b>Department Secretaries.</b> In a graded Sunday
school there should be an assistant secretary for
each department, who may be one of the teachers,
or in the Senior and Adult grades, one of the
scholars. He should take the records of the
classes in the department and transmit them to
the secretary of the school. But the secretary is
responsible for the records of the entire school,
and should see personally that the record of each
department is complete.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '5'">6</ins> . <b>Duties.</b> The work of the secretary may be
classified as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Record of Meetings.</i> As secretary of the
board of teachers and officers, he should be present
at all business meetings and make a careful record.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Every motion should be stated clearly, with the
names of its mover and its seconder, and the
action taken. A statement should be given of
every committee appointed, its purpose, and the
names of its members. All committees should be
expected to present written reports, however brief.
A concise summary of each report, in a few sentences,
or a single clause, should appear in the
minutes of the meeting at which the report is
presented; and the report itself should be filed
for reference in case it should be needed. A committee
once named is on the minutes, and cannot
be ignored nor forgotten until its report has been
presented and adopted, and the committee has
been formally discharged. For example, it is not
sufficient for the committee on the Christmas entertainment
to hold the entertainment; it must
afterward report that the entertainment was held
on a certain date; must have its report adopted,
and receive its discharge. It should be the duty
of the secretary from time to time to call for
reports of committees named in the minutes of
previous meetings, to insist that a report be
rendered, and that some action be taken upon it.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Record of the School.</i> In every well-ordered
Sunday school the secretary summarizes in writing
the attendance in each department, the total
attendance, the number of new scholars, and
other items to be preserved, including the weather,
which may sometimes account for a small attendance;
also a comparison with the record of the
same Sunday last year. This report should be
read to the school by the secretary at the call of
the superintendent, or posted before the school;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and it should also be recorded in a book which
will contain the statistics of the school through a
term of years.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Records of Classes.</i> The secretary and his
assistants should prepare the books in which the
class record of attendance is recorded. The name
of each scholar should be given correctly and
fully (for example, not "F. Jones," but "Frederick
Jones"). The secretary should see that the record
of attendance for each Sunday is accurately kept.
He will need to give special attention to classes
where substitutes take the place of absent teachers,
and to see that the record for the day is not
neglected. As often as the arrangement of the
class books requires the rewriting of the names of
the scholars, he should transcribe the list, always
writing every name in full. In looking through
the class lists he should note the names of those
who have been absent for a series of sessions,
and should report them to the superintendent, for
consideration and for investigation of every habitual
absentee. If these scholars can be visited,
many of them may be retained in the school.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Records of Scholars.</i> In addition to the
record in the class books, another record should
be kept of every member of the school, including
every officer, teacher, and scholar; a card catalogue,
each name upon a separate card, and all the cards
filed in alphabetical order. The card for each
scholar should give besides his name the date of
his entrance to the school, either the date of his
birth or his age at entering&mdash;approximative, if
above eighteen years; his residence, with street
and number in a city; parents' names; class to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which he is assigned; his relation to the church or
congregation, and any other important facts. The
card should contain the record of every promotion,
and its date; of any changes in residence, and
other details, so that it becomes a reliable and
complete history of each individual in the school.
In many schools the birthday of each member is
kept upon the record, and is recognized by sending
a birthday card. If a scholar or teacher leaves
the school the fact is recorded, and the card is
then taken from the regular catalogue and filed
permanently in the list of "former members."</p>

<p>(5) <i>Literature of the School.</i> The secretary
should be in charge of the literature used by the
school, its text-books, lesson-quarterlies, and other
periodicals. He should see that the literature is
ordered in full time, should receive it, keep it in
his care, and attend to its distribution. The particular
text-book for each grade is fixed by the
superintendent; and the secretary should receive
from him direction as to the lesson helps for each
grade.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Correspondence.</i> The secretary should conduct
all correspondence in behalf of the school or
of the teachers as a body, unless for a special
purpose the chairman of a committee be in charge
of correspondence relating to his work.</p>

<p>The secretary who with the aid of his staff
undertakes to do all the work that rises before him
will not find his task a light one. But his department
carried on with vigor will greatly promote
the success of the Sunday school.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TREASURY AND THE TREASURER</div>


<p>1. <b>In the Early Sunday School.</b> A study of origins
has shown that in the earliest Sunday schools
in America, as in England, provision was made for
the payment of officers and teachers. In the first
schools established in and near Philadelphia, each
paid teacher had charge of what would now be
considered a department, and the practical teaching
was given under his direction by scholars, who
were called monitors. But in a new country, where
the settlements were small and the people mostly
poor, the system of paid teachers soon passed
away, and the schools were carried on by voluntary
and unpaid workers. It was fortunate for the
American Sunday school that in its beginnings it
required but little money. For the place of meeting
any chapel or schoolhouse or settler's cabin
would serve. The literature was exceedingly
meager&mdash;a few Testaments and spelling books, and
generally these were brought by the teachers and
scholars. When the earliest lesson books were
published, they were not quarterlies, nor annuals,
to be thrown away after one using, but were studied
year after year. The largest item of expense was the
library; and as this was an institution for the entire
neighborhood, the families willingly contributed toward
it. Not until the Sunday school had become
thoroughly founded did the question of its financial
support arise as a problem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <b>In the Modern Sunday School.</b> As the Sunday
school advanced in position, in influence, and in
better methods of work, its expenses naturally
increased. Now, in the opening of its second
century, its financial requirements are far greater
than they were even a generation ago. It asks
for special and suitable buildings, with rooms and
furnishings adapted to the educational needs of its
several departments; for a periodical literature
suited to teachers and scholars of every grade, and
requiring to be renewed every year; for an organ
or piano&mdash;often for several, with an orchestra
added; for an equipment of song books different
from those in the church service; for entertainments
and gifts at Christmas, and a day's outing
for all in the summer; for libraries containing
popular books for the scholars and helpful works
for the teachers in their work. The demands of
a large and growing Sunday school, in city or
country, are great, but in nearly all congregations
the funds for the support of the Sunday school are
obtained with less effort than those for any other
department of church activity, and in this liberality
the Christian people show their wisdom and insight.</p>

<p>3. <b>Practical Ways and Means.</b> The methods of
financial support for the Sunday school are exceedingly
varied. The simplest plan is through a
regular weekly contribution in the classes. Where
attention is given to the collection, and an appeal
is occasionally made in its behalf, the school will
generally obtain the funds needed for its own
support. When the special need arises for the
purchase of a piano or a library, some entertainment
may be held which will by its profits swell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the receipts. The objection to these methods,
which are almost universal, is that they appeal to
self-interest, and fail to educate the members of
the school in true liberality. It is for <i>our</i> school,
<i>our</i> piano, <i>our</i> library, that the appeal is made
and the money is contributed. The scholars should
be taught to give to the cause of Christ and his
gospel, and not merely to interests from which they
themselves are to receive a reward.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Ideal Way of Giving.</b> The more excellent
way is for the church in its annual estimate of
expenses to include a fair, even liberal, allowance
for the Sunday school, and at intervals through
the year pass over to the treasury of the Sunday
school the funds appropriated, to be expended
according to principles and regulations provided.
Then let every officer, teacher, and pupil in the
school, from the Adult Department to the Primary,
and even to the Beginners, make his own weekly
offering to the church. Most church schools contribute
to the cause of foreign missions; but there
is equal reason why they should give to all the
general benevolent objects for which the church
receives an annual collection. This plan would
unite the church and the school more firmly, would
avoid multiplying and conflicting objects for which
funds are raised, and, best of all, would train every
child in the Sunday school to systematic giving
upon the true gospel principle, which is "not to be
ministered unto, but to minister."</p>

<p>5. <b>The Sunday-School Treasurer.</b> The work of
the treasurer is very different from that of the
secretary; yet the two offices are often held by
one person. In that case they should be regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
as distinct positions; the election to the two
offices should be separate, and not at the same
time for one person as secretary and treasurer.
At every business meeting a separate report should
be presented for the two departments, and the
treasurership should not be regarded as a branch
of the secretary's work. If the plan outlined in
the last paragraph be adopted as the method of
providing for the financial needs of the Sunday
school, it might be well to choose the treasurer of
the church as treasurer of the Sunday school, thus
giving unity to the financial administration of the
entire organization.</p>

<p>6. <b>The Treasurer's Work.</b> This will require a
person who is known as careful in accounts, as
well as honorable in all his dealings.</p>

<p>(1) <i>His Charge.</i> All the funds of the Sunday
school should pass through his hands. If money
is raised for any purpose, or a money-making
entertainment is held, the treasurer should take
charge of the receipts and pay the bills. For this
purpose he should be ex officio a member of all
committees required to receive and disburse funds.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Bank Account.</i> Except in small and remote
places, the treasurer will find it desirable to keep
an account with a bank in behalf of the school,
and deposit therein all moneys received. Under
no circumstances should he deposit Sunday-school
funds as a part of his own private account, but
should keep separate accounts as an individual and
as treasurer.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Reports and Vouchers.</i> At each meeting of
the governing board of the school he should present
a statement of the condition of the treasury,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with exact mention of all moneys received and
paid since the last meeting; and for every payment
he should show a receipt or voucher, and on it the
"O. K." or approval of some qualified person who
knows that it is correct.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Bills.</i> He should receive all bills against the
school, and should inform himself concerning them,
in order to be able to answer any questions raised
by members of the board. He should present at
the meeting a statement of all the unpaid bills
on hand, with a forecast of bills expected, and
obtain a vote of the board upon each bill that is
to be paid.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Checks.</i> It is desirable to pay bills as far as
possible with checks, as the check will often serve
as a receipt; and the receipted bills should be filed
together for reference.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Audits.</i> An Auditing Committee should be
appointed, to examine the accounts of the school
from time to time, and always when the treasurer
completes his term, alike whether he is re&euml;lected
or gives place to a successor. This committee
should either present a written report, or should
sign their names to the treasurer's report, with the
indorsement, "Audited and found correct."</p>

<p>Most of the above recommendations, perhaps all
of them, state the methods that would be followed
by any intelligent, businesslike treasurer. But in
the continent-wide area of the Sunday school, of
necessity, not all treasurers are intelligent or experienced
in business methods; and there are doubtless
many who may profit by these suggestions.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Study of Benevolent Interests.</i> One of the
most important duties of a treasurer in a modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Sunday school is to study the different charitable
objects that present themselves to the school, decide
upon their merits, and then present them
understandingly to the members of the school, with
a view to eliciting their interest and training
them in the spirit and habit of intelligent giving.
This important task raises the treasurership out of
mere mechanical service, and constitutes it one of
the directing forces in the school.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>VALUE OF THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL LIBRARY</div>


<p>1. <b>The Library of the Past.</b> Until quite recent
times the Sunday-school library was understood to
be a collection of books, mainly of an entertaining
character, kept in the school, distributed at its
sessions, and read by the scholars, for enjoyment
rather than for instruction. Such a library was
regarded as an essential of the Sunday school.
However small or however poor the school, it
must have a library. Books were scarce, and
desirable books were high in price. There were no
free public libraries, and few circulating libraries.
The library was regarded as the principal attraction
of the school, and it drew the scholars. Many
children attended two Sunday schools in order to
obtain each week two library books. The books
were read by all the family; and in many homes
the Sunday-school library furnished most of the
reading matter. The literature may not have been
of the highest grade, but, with all its defects, the
Sunday-school library of the past was a useful and
valuable institution.</p>

<p>2. <b>Its Decline in the Present.</b> In recent times,
and especially in well-settled and cultured communities,
the Sunday-school library has lost much
of its importance. Very many schools have closed
their libraries; and in the schools continuing their
use only a small proportion of the scholars obtain
books. Inquiry has shown that in cities and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
suburban towns a school of two hundred members
will include not more than thirty who make use
of the library. When the library is closed scarcely
any complaints from the scholars are heard; nor
is the closing of the library followed by a loss of
scholars. Publishing houses which formerly issued
fifty new books each year, especially for Sunday-school
libraries, have entirely abandoned this
branch of business. It cannot be maintained that
the Sunday-school library for the entertainment of
the scholars now holds a prominent place, or is a
factor of success, in the best American Sunday
schools.</p>

<p>3. <b>Causes of Decline.</b> It is not difficult to find
reasons for this present lack of interest in the
Sunday-school library. Books are now far more
abundant than they were formerly. They are sold
cheaply, and are to be found in almost every
home. The periodical literature in circulation to-day
is apparently a hundredfold greater than it
was two generations ago. Every city and almost
every town has its public library. Many schools
are furnished with free libraries. Readers can
scarcely find time for the books and magazines
that are open to them. Moreover, the Sunday
school now stands in such recognized honor and
power that it no longer needs the old-time library
as a bait for scholars. The library for mere recreation
does not readily fit into the general scheme
of education in the modern Sunday school. Then,
too, the educational work of the school demands
such an outfit of books and periodicals, renewed
each year, that the additional expense of the
library is a heavy burden. Sharp criticism is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
passed upon the quality of the books in most
Sunday-school libraries, as being almost wholly
stories, and stories of a cheap and commonplace
character, many of them absolutely injurious. The
conducting of the library is often found to interfere
with the order and work of the school. These
are among the causes which have led to disuse of
the library in many Sunday schools.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Uses of a Good Library.</b> Notwithstanding
the objections to the Sunday-school library, its
neglect by many scholars, and its abolition in
many schools, the fact remains that the majority
of Sunday schools still retain the library, and
claim that it is needed. There are even places
where the Sunday-school library holds its own
constituency in competition with the town library;
and in small villages the Sunday school supplies
most of the books in circulation. The principal
claims made in behalf of such a library are the
following:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Family Needs.</i> Every family needs good
reading matter. The books that interest the young
generally interest the old also. People who would
be at a loss to select a book from the shelves of a
public library will read the book brought to them
from the Sunday-school library. The reading of
the library-book fills leisure time on Sunday afternoons
and on long winter evenings.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Moral Influence.</i> While most Sunday-school
books as literature are open to criticism, yet in
the realm of ethics they generally present high
ideals. The characters depicted in them may not
be symmetrical, but on the whole they are earnest
and upright. Youth admires heroism; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
personalities portrayed in popular Sunday-school
books are generally heroic, even though they may
be unduly emotional. The boys who are picked up
by the police in railroad centers, armed for fighting
Indians or robbing trains, generally carry an assortment
of cheap novels, but they are not from
Sunday-school libraries. If the criterion be ethics
and not literature, most Sunday-school books will
stand the test.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Aid to the School.</i> As has been already
suggested, the original aim of the library was to
attract scholars to the school. In many places
this influence is no longer needed; but there still
remain communities where scholars are obtained
and families are interested by means of the library.
And it is an open question whether if the library
had advanced step by step with the other departments
of the school, if the same attention had
been given to the supply and management of the
library as has been given to the educational work,
if the right books had been kept upon its shelves,
and advanced methods had been sought in their
distribution, the library of the Sunday school
might not still be a vigorous and successful institution.</p>

<p>5. <b>Principles of Selection.</b> If the governing board
of the school decides that a library for general
reading by the scholars is desirable, the question
at once arises as to what principles shall determine
the selection of books. A few of these principles
may be stated:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Variety.</i> The library should represent more
than one department of literature. So general is
the taste for stories that the tendency will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
inevitable to overload the library with works of
fiction. Therefore special care should be given to
include in it the lives of great and good men&mdash;heroes,
statesmen, explorers, leaders of the church,
and missionaries. All of these present life on its
romantic side, and may be found written in an
entertaining manner. Upon the shelves should also
be placed history and science&mdash;not in many-volumed
treatises for scholars, but in popular books
for young people. In fact, there are few departments
of a good public library which may not
properly be included in the library of the Sunday
school, especially in places where the school is
expected to supply the reading matter for the
community.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Popularity.</i> Merely to place books on the
shelves of a Sunday-school library will not insure
the reading of them. This library aims to be
emphatically a circulating library. Its books are
not for show, but for use; and their place to be
seen is not on the shelves of the library-room, but
in the homes of the scholars and teachers. It is
absolutely essential that no book be placed in
the library unless it is sufficiently interesting to be
taken out and read, for an unread book is worse
than <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'useles'">useless</ins> in the Sunday-school library. Although
its principles be as sound as the Ten Commandments,
if it be dull it must be condemned. Students
may be willing to plod through an uninteresting
book because it is profitable, but ordinary readers,
especially youthful readers, will turn from it.
Books should not be purchased because they are
good, or because they are cheap; nor, on the other
hand, should they be chosen only because they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
popular; yet an interesting, popular quality should
be an absolute requirement in every book placed
upon the library shelves.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Literary Quality.</i> Books are influential
teachers, and a style like that of Hawthorne or
Eliot will unconsciously mold the language of those
who read it. On the other hand, the habitual
readers of the slang in the comic paragraph of the
newspaper will talk in a careless and inelegant
manner. Of course, all books should be excluded
from the library which deal in low, profane, or
immoral language, without regarding the specious
plea that such describe life as it is. We do not
need to learn the language of the slums to know
life; and, as one writer has said, we do not want
a realism that can be touched only with a pair of
tongs. The best pirate story in the English language
is one that is without an oath from cover to
cover,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and we would not exclude it from the
Sunday-school library. Let us seek for writers
whose expression is direct, smooth, and cultured.
The Sunday school in its literature as well as its
teaching should lead upward toward refinement of
taste.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Moral Teaching.</i> The ethical standard of
every book in the Sunday-school library should be
of the highest. Not that every paragraph should
end with the application like the <i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>
of &AElig;sop's fables, or that the characters in a story
should be of a "goody-goody" kind, or that none
but good people should appear upon the page.
There must be some shadows in the perspective
that the light may stand in contrast. But in no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
case should wrong, or sin, or the doubtful moralities
of modern society be made attractive.
Moral problem stories, in which the boundary lines
of right and wrong conduct are crossed and re-crossed
until right seems wrong, and wrong seems
right, should have no place. "Should love stories
be admitted?" Not if the element of love enters
as the dominant thought of the book. A story
should not be forbidden because there is a pair of
lovers in it; but it should not be accepted if the
book shows no higher motive than to set forth
their passion. Books should be sought that will
inculcate a noble manliness for young men and a
noble womanliness for young women, and there are
such books in numbers sufficient to fill the library
shelves.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Christian Spirit.</i> It is not required that
every book should set forth and illustrate a spiritual
experience. It may be religious without preaching
religion. But the morals it inculcates should be
founded upon the gospels and inspired by faith.
It should be reverent in its treatment of the Bible,
of the church, and of the ministry. A book or a
story designed to weaken belief in the Scriptures
as records of the divine will, or holding the church
up to scorn, or showing a minister as its villain,
should be kept out of the Sunday-school library.
Criticism or discussion of the Bible, of the church,
and of the ministry has its place, but its place is
not in the Sunday school. The Sunday school is
distinctively a religious and a Christian institution,
and the atmosphere of the Christian religion should
pervade its library.</p>

<p>6. <b>The Coming Sunday-School Library.</b> Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
library of a higher type than that designed for the
reading and recreation of the scholars is now
arising to notice in many advanced Sunday schools,
and is destined to become the Sunday-school
library of the future, either supplementing the
library of the past or taking its place. It is
the library which is to the Sunday school what the
college library is to the college, a workshop equipped
with tools for the use of the teacher and the
scholar. It will be at once a reference library,
containing the best Bible dictionaries, cyclopedias,
expository works, and gospel harmonies, open at
certain times for the use of students; and also a
lending library of books upon the Bible, upon the
Sunday school, upon teaching, upon religion, upon
character, and upon the varied forms of social
service which are now calling for workers, and will
call yet more imperatively in the coming years.
The books for this library must be chosen with
wisdom; for they should represent the results of
the best scholarship, yet be expressed in language
that the nonprofessional reader can understand;
and many of them must be for the scholars, who
are of all ages and all degrees of intelligence.
Those of the Primary Department should be able
to find in such a library the stories of the Bible
told in such a fascinating manner that a child
too young to read them may listen to them with
interest, and picture-books illustrating the events,
the people, the dress, and the landscape of the
Bible. It should be planned to meet the needs of
every grade in the Sunday school, and to aid
every teacher and every scholar; and when established
it should be made effective in the educational<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
work of the school. Just as in the secular school
and the college students are sent to the library
with directions as to the books they will need, so
in the Sunday school teachers will be able to
counsel their scholars and to give them week-day
work, so that the teaching will be more than the
talk of the teacher; it will embrace the results of
searching on the part of the scholar. Under the
system of uniform lessons the use of such a library
was well-nigh impracticable, because every class
would need the same books at one time. But the
uniform lessons are being rapidly displaced by the
graded system, giving to each grade its own series
of lessons; and this method, requiring different
books for each age in the school, will open the way
for reference work and study in the library. The
time is at hand when such a working library will
become a necessity in every well-organized school.</p>

<p>7. <b>The Public Library and the Sunday School.</b>
It would seem that wherever the public library is
free, available, and well conducted some arrangement
might be effected whereby the Sunday-school
libraries could be united with the public library.
This would lessen expense and difficulty in management,
would avoid the unnecessary reduplication
of copies of the same books, and would give to
the scholars at once a wider selection and the
advantage of the open shelf. In more than one
town this has been accomplished. The Sunday
schools have transferred all their libraries to the
public library, to its enlargement, and with no
loss of members to the schools. Some Sunday
schools in cities have been recognized as branch
stations of the public library, giving them the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
benefit of frequent changes in the equipment of
books, which at regular intervals are selected from
the store of the public library by the library committee
of the school. The working library for
teachers and scholars, proposed in the last paragraph,
in many places might be established in
the public library, wherever the schools in the
community will unite to show that it is needed, to
name the books required, and to make it practically
useful.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h2>XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MANAGEMENT OF THE LIBRARY</div>


<p>1. <b>Library Committee.</b> For the selection of
books, whether in the reading library for scholars
or the working library for teachers and scholars,
a wise, intelligent, and careful committee should
be chosen, and should be maintained in permanent
service. The pastor and the superintendent
should be ex-officio members of this committee, but
it should also include some other persons sufficiently
acquainted with books to pass upon their merits,
and willing to give time, inquiry, and thought to
the library. There may be schools fortunate in
possessing librarians who devote themselves to the
selection of books, as well as to the care of them;
and in such schools the library committees will find
their labors lessened. No book should be admitted
to the library without examination and approval
by the committee.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Purchase of Books.</i> The simplest method
for finding books is far from being the best method.
It is to have a quantity of books&mdash;a hundred or
more at one time&mdash;sent by booksellers on approval.
This method involves hasty examination, and generally
results in obtaining many useless, worthless
books intermixed with a few good ones. The
better plan is for the committee, first of all, to be
supplied with catalogues from reputable publishers
of books for children and young people, and also
books on religious and biblical education; next to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
read carefully the reviews of books in these departments
as given in the best literary and religious
periodicals; then, to send only for such books as
they judge will be desirable, receiving them on
approval. Every book should not only be looked
at, but read; and if at all doubtful read by more
than one member of the committee. In some
Sunday schools there is placed at the door a
library box, in which may be deposited the names
of books desired by members of the school. Lists
of approved books are published by various houses
and societies; and the catalogues of a few good
Sunday-school libraries will aid committees. The
library committee must scrutinize closely all donations
of books offered to the library, and resolutely
decline every book that is unsuitable, even at the
risk of offending the donor. The Sunday-school
library room must not be turned into a mausoleum
for dead volumes. The committee must also beware
of bargains offered by some booksellers who
would unload upon Sunday schools their left-over
and unsalable stock. That which costs little is
generally worth less. The Sunday school must
obtain only books that will be read and are worth
reading.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Frequent Additions.</i> The usual method is to
use the old library until its best books are either
worn out or lost, and then to make a strenuous
effort at raising money for the purchase of an
entirely new collection. But the better plan is to
add a few carefully selected books each month to
the library. To examine at one time two hundred
volumes is an impossibility, and in so large a
purchase many undesirable books are sure to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
included. It is not difficult to select after careful
examination ten books each month, and thereby
keep the library always at a high grade of excellence.
With each purchase a slip describing
the new books might be printed, and distributed
to the school, thus keeping the library constantly
before its patrons.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Librarian.</b> There is a close analogy between
the work of the librarian in the public
library and that in the Sunday school. For the
public library everywhere a specialist is sought, one
who knows books, can select them wisely, and
can aid seekers after literature in their reading.
The Sunday school needs just such a librarian,
and all the more because the scholars cannot
select from the open shelf, but must guess at the
quality of a book from its title in the catalogue.
It has been noticed that wherever a Sunday-school
library is successful in holding the interest of the
scholars there is found with it a librarian adapted
to his work and devoting himself to it. We notice
the characteristics of a good librarian in the
Sunday school:</p>

<p>(1) <i>A Bookman.</i> He is a lover of books, acquainted
with them, and interested in good
literature. His work is more than to distribute
books: he should aid, sometimes supervise, their
collection.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A Business Man.</i> He is practical, orderly,
and systematic in his ways of working; with a plan
for his task, and fidelity in accomplishing it.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Gentle in Manner.</i> Opportunities will be
frequent for the librarian to clash with the scholars
on the one hand, or with the superintendent upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the other. With one he may appear arbitrary,
with the other disorderly, his work sometimes
breaking into the program of exercises. He should
be pleasant toward all, uniform in his dealings,
and attentive to the general order of the school.</p>

<p>3. <b>His Assistants.</b> In most schools one assistant,
in large schools several assistants, will be required
by the librarian. He should nominate them, subject
to the approval of the governing board of the
school; and should require of them regular and
prompt attendance, and attention to their work in
the library. It is very desirable that the business
should be so arranged as to allow the librarians
to take part in the opening devotional service
with the school, and not to be at work arranging
books while others are at prayer.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Management of the Library.</b> This involves
four processes: the collection, the assignment, the
distribution, and the return of the books.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Collection.</i> The books can easily be
collected without interfering with the order of the
school, if the library window is near the entrance
to the building, and the scholars as they enter
leave their books at the library. This is the
method employed in most schools.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Assignment.</i> How to enable each scholar
to choose his book introduces one of the three
problems in library management. The plan generally
followed is to supply each scholar with
a card bearing a number which represents the
scholar. He selects from the catalogue a large
assortment of books, and writes their numbers
upon his card: the librarian assigns the scholar any
one of the books selected, crosses it from his list,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and upon another list marks the number of the
book opposite the number of the scholar. The
weakness of the plan is in the fact that the scholar
has no means of learning from the catalogue what
books are desirable; and a book desired by one
may be entirely undesirable to another. Theoretically
the scholar has the whole catalogue from
which to choose; practically he has no choice,
except the suggestion in the titles of the books.
The open-shelf plan cannot be established in the
Sunday school, for the room is usually too small,
the time of the session is too brief, and the work
of the school too important to allow interruption.</p>

<p>In some graded Sunday schools another plan is
pursued, taking from the scholar all choice, but
assigning to each grade books of certain numbers,
all printed upon the card of the scholar, any one
of which books he may receive at any time during
his stay in the grade, but each of which will fall
to his lot but once. This plan demands a library
of books carefully selected, and as carefully fitted
to each grade in the school. But this method is
apt to be unsatisfactory to the scholars, who have
their own preferences among the books. The
difficulties in assigning books, and disappointments
of scholars in failing to obtain the books desired,
is a frequent cause for the disuse of the library;
and this problem has not as yet been fully solved.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Distribution.</i> This takes place at the
close of the school, and brings in the second
problem of library management. The books may
be brought to the classes by the librarians, and
distributed by the teachers; each scholar's book
being indicated by his card placed within it. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
method often causes confusion; scholars being dissatisfied
with their books and leaving their classes
press around the library. Sometimes they exchange
books with each other. This is a simple plan as
far as the two scholars exchanging are concerned,
but sure to make trouble in the record of the
librarian. Or each class may be dismissed in turn,
and obtain its books at the library window while
passing out. But this plan causes a congestion of
scholars at the library, and also requires much
time. To manage the distribution of books demands
a strong will, coupled with a gentle manner
in maintaining the library rules.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Return.</i> The theory of the Sunday-school
library is that each scholar will bring his
book back after a week or two weeks. But boys and
girls&mdash;sometimes older scholars also&mdash;are apt to be
careless. Books are exchanged between scholars,
are loaned from one home to another, are forgotten,
and are lost. And the books lost most readily are
frequently those that are most sought for by the
scholars. How to induce scholars invariably to
return their books constitutes the third problem
of library management. In many schools the
percentage of lost books is exceedingly large. The
librarian should do his utmost to reduce the loss
to a minimum. To this end a few suggestions
may be given:</p>

<p>(a) Record of Scholars. Every scholar's name
and address, with his library number, should be
kept on record in the library; and every effort
should be made to make the record conform to all
changes in residence.</p>

<p>(b) Record Sheet. The library should contain a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
record sheet, showing the number of every book
issued, and the number of the scholar receiving it;
to be canceled when the book is returned. This
will show who is responsible for every book out
of its place from the library.</p>

<p>(c) Fines. A fine should be assessed upon the
scholar for every book kept over time; and notice
sent to the scholar at his home when a fine has
become due.</p>

<p>(d) Rewards. Scholars should be paid a reward,
perhaps of ten cents for each book, if they can
succeed in tracing and finding any book which
has been out of the library two months or more.
These plans, or others, may lessen, but no plan
will entirely remove, the evil of books lost to the
library through neglect or a worse crime.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TEACHER'S QUALIFICATIONS AND NEED OF TRAINING</div>


<p>While the superintendent in the school is the
moving and guiding intelligence, the pulse of the
machine, the teacher in the class is the worker
at the anvil, or the loom, or the lathe, for whom
all the plans are made, and upon whom all the
success depends. In the warfare for souls he is
on the picket line and at close range, fighting
face to face and hand to hand. The sphere of his
effort is small, that group gathered around him
for an hour on Sunday, but in that little field his
is the work that counts for the final victory. His
task requires peculiar adaptedness, supplemented
by special training.</p>

<p>1. <b>His Qualifications.</b> There are on the American
continent not less than a million and a half Sunday-school
teachers, who give to the gospel their
free-will offering of time, and toil, and thought.
They are not like civil engineers or the majority
of public-school teachers, graduates of schools that
have given them training for a special vocation.
In every respect they are laymen, engaged for six
days in secular work, and on one day finding an
avocation in the Sunday school. Yet there are
certain traits, partly natural and partly acquired,
which they must possess, if they are to find success
in their Sabbath-day service.</p>

<p>(1) <i>A Sincere Disciple.</i> The Sunday-school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
teacher must be a follower of Christ, not merely
in profession but in spirit. He is one who has
met his Lord, has heard and has obeyed the call,
"Follow me." He enlisted in the grand army of
which Christ is the Commander, before he received
his assignment to the army corps of the Sunday
school, and his fidelity to the department is inspired
by his deeper loyalty to his Lord. It is
eminently desirable that the Sunday-school teacher
should be a member of the church; but it is imperative
that he should be a disciple of Christ.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A Lover of Youth.</i> By far the largest proportion
of scholars in the Sunday school, perhaps
nine tenths, are under twenty-five years of age.
Therefore, with few exceptions, the teachers must
deal with young people; and youth at all its stages
is not easy to understand and to manage. Moreover,
the fact that not only the teachers, but to
a large extent the scholars, are volunteers enters
into the problem. Pupils attend the week-day
school and submit to a teacher's rule because they
must, whether their teachers are acceptable or are
disliked. But the rule in the Sunday school is
not the law of authority; it is the law of persuasion.
The teacher who cannot draw his scholars, but
repels them, soon finds himself without a class.
In all teaching sympathy, or the co&ouml;rdination between
the interest of the teacher in the pupil and
of the pupil in the teacher, is a strong factor in
success; but in the Sunday school it is an absolute
necessity by reason of the voluntary element in the
constitution of the Sunday school. That mystic
power which will combine uncongenial spirits, and
fuse the hearts of teacher and scholar into one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is love. Let the teacher love his scholars, let him
see in each pupil some quality to inspire love,
and the battle is half won. Love will quicken
tact, and love and tact together will win the complete
victory.</p>

<p>(3) <i>A Lover of the Scriptures.</i> Whatever the
Sunday school of to-morrow may become, the
Sunday school of to-day is pre&euml;minently a Bible
school. There are tendencies in our time which
may in another generation render the Bible less
prominent, and introduce into the Sunday school
studies in church history, in social science, in
moral reform, in missions, perhaps in comparative
religion, or in some other departments of knowledge.
But as yet the great text-book of the
school is the Holy Scriptures. The volume should
be in the hand of every teacher and of every
scholar during the school session; and the teacher,
especially, must study it during the week. If all
of the Bible that he knows is contained in the
paragraphs assigned for the coming lesson, and the
rest of the book is sealed to his eyes, he will be
a very poor teacher. He needs to have his mind
stored with a thousand facts, and to have these
facts systematized, in order to teach ten; and the
nine hundred and ninety which he knows will add
all their weight to the ten which he tells.</p>

<p>(4) <i>A Willing Worker.</i> The teacher's love for
Christ, for his scholars, and for his Bible is not
to expend itself in emotion or even in study;
it is to find expression in efficient service. A task
is laid upon him which will demand much of his
time and his power of body, mind, and spirit.
He must be ready to meet his class fifty-two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Sundays in the year: on days of sunshine and days
of storm; when he is eager for the work, and when
he is weary in it; when his scholars are responsive,
and when they are careless; when his fellow
workers are congenial, and when they are anti-pathetic;
when his lesson is easy to teach, and
when it is hard. He must be regular in his service,
not turned aside by opportunities of enjoyment
elsewhere; and he must give to it all his powers
and all his skill. Work such as this can be sustained
only by an enduring enthusiasm, a devotion
to the cause; and therefore the teacher must
have his heart enlisted as well as his will.</p>

<p>As a Sunday-school teacher, then, four harmonious
objects will claim a share in his love: his
Lord, his scholars, his Bible, and his work.</p>

<p>2. <b>His Need of Training.</b> For two generations it
was supposed that any person fairly intelligent,
without special equipment, was fitted to be a
Sunday-school teacher. There are found no records
of training classes in Sunday-school work earlier
than 1855, when the Rev. John H. Vincent began
to gather young people and train them for service
in his Sunday school at Irvington, New Jersey.
The seed of his "Palestine Class" grew into the
"Normal Class"; and by 1869 there were in a
few places classes for the teaching of teachers in
the Bible and Sunday-school work. It is not
remarkable that Sunday-school teacher-training
should be delayed so long after the organization
of the first Sunday school, when it is remembered
that in America the first Normal School for secular
teachers was not founded until 1839. The Chautauqua
movement, begun in 1874, gave a strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
impetus to Sunday-school teacher-training; the
state associations and denominational organizations
took up the work; and now teacher-training classes
are to be found in every state and province on the
American continent. The thoroughly graded school
includes in its system a class for the training of
young people who are to be teachers.</p>

<p>It is late in the day to inquire why the Sunday-school
teacher needs training; but the question is
often asked, and the answers are ready:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The General Principle.</i> All good work involves
the prerequisite of training. Especially is
this true of teaching; and there is a reason why
the principle holds with regard to the Sunday-school
teacher even more directly than with the
secular teacher. While the subjects of teaching are
vitally important, relating to character and efficient
service, the time for teaching is short, less than
an hour each week, in contrast to the twenty or
twenty-five hours in the week-day school. To
make an impression in so short a teaching period,
with such long intervals between the lessons, demands
that the teacher be one who possesses
exceptional fitness for his work, and this superior
fitness cannot be obtained without special and
thorough training.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Teacher's Responsibility.</i> All-important
as is the work of religious teaching, for which the
Bible is the chief text-book in the church, there
is but one institution in our time charged with
that mighty duty, and that is the Sunday school.
The Bible is rarely taught in the home, which
should be the first place for teaching it; it is only
incidentally taught in the pulpit, of which the aim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is not so much instruction as inspiration. Practically
all the teaching of the Bible now devolves
upon the Sunday school, and the Sunday school
only. If the Sunday schools of the world for one
generation should fail to teach the word of life,
the knowledge of that word would well-nigh cease.
And the one person charged with that task, the
one on whom the responsibility rests, is the Sunday-school
teacher. He who is intrusted with so great
a work, and upon whose fidelity the work depends,
must have a proper equipment; and that equipment
presupposes training.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Demand of the Age.</i> We are living in
an intellectual age, unparalleled in the history of
the world. The boundaries of knowledge in every
direction have widened, and in each realm the
search is deeper and more thorough. Such wealth
has been added through recent investigations to
the store of Bible knowledge that most commentaries,
expositions, and introductions of the
past have now but slight value. Another exceedingly
important realm that has been added to the
domain of knowledge is that of child study, but
recently an unexplored field, now open to every
reader. In such a time as this the teacher who
would impart the contents of the Bible to the
young must have eyes and mind opened. He must
know the results of modern investigation in
the Scriptures and in the nature of those whom
he teaches. His pupils are under the care of
trained and alert specialists through the week;
they must receive instruction from well-taught
minds in the Sunday school.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Teacher and His Class.</i> The peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
relation already referred to as existing between the
Sunday-school teacher and his class presents another
incentive to training. His relation is not like
that of the secular teacher, who speaks with
authority, and can command attention and study.
The teacher in Sunday school cannot require his
scholars to learn the lesson; the authority of the
parent is rarely employed to compel home study;
and as a result most of our scholars come to the
Sunday school unprepared. This is not the ideal
or the ultimate condition, but unfortunately it is
still the real condition in at least nine out of ten
Sunday-school classes. This condition makes the
demand upon the teacher all the greater. Because
his scholars are unprepared he must be all the
better prepared. He must be able to awaken and
arouse his pupils; he must inspire them to an
interest in the lesson; he must so teach as to lead
them into knowledge of the truth and a desire to
seek it for themselves. Anyone can teach the
scholar who is eager to learn; but to teach those
who come to the class unprepared and careless,
to send them away with a clear-cut understanding
of the lesson, and an awakened intelligence and
conscience&mdash;all this, under the conditions of the
Sunday-school teacher's task, and in his peculiar
relation to his scholars, requires not only ability,
but also thoroughly trained ability.</p>

<p>In view of all these considerations, it is not
surprising that at the opening of the twentieth
century the demand of the Sunday schools everywhere
is for better teaching, and for teachers who
have themselves been taught and are able to
teach others.</p>

<h2><a name="CH_XIV" id="CH_XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TRAINING AND TASK OF THE TEACHER</div>


<p>1. <b>The Training Needed.</b> Many faithful workers
in the Sunday school realize their need of preparation;
but, while conscious of unfitness, they have
no clear conception of the equipment which they
require. What are those fields of knowledge which
should be traversed by one who has been called
to teach in the Sunday school? They comprise
four departments: (1) the Book, (2) the scholar,
(3) the school, and (4) the work.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Book.</i> We have already noted that the
Sunday school is differentiated from other systems
of education in the fact that it uses mainly but
one text-book, the Holy Scriptures. For that
reason the teacher must first of all acquaint himself
as thoroughly as possible with the contents of
that wonderful volume. He should be a twentieth
century Bible student; not a student or a scholar
according to the light of the Middle Ages, or the
seventeenth century, or even of the first half of
the nineteenth century; for in all those periods the
aims, the methods, and the scope of Bible study
were different from those of the present time.
He who is to teach the Bible successfully to-day
must have some knowledge of the Bible in the
following aspects:</p>

<p>(a) Its Origin and Nature. He must have
a definite idea of how the sixty-six books of
Scripture were composed, written, and preserved;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and, as far as may be known, who were
their authors.</p>

<p>(b) Its History. The Bible is, more than anything
else, a book of history, containing the record
of a people who received the divine revelation and
preserved it. The divine revelation cannot be
taught nor comprehended unless the annals of that
remarkable people, the Israelites, be first read and
understood. Therefore biblical history should be
the first subject to be studied by the teacher in
the Sunday school. The leading facts and underlying
principles of that unique history must be
understood; not in an outline of minute details,
but as a general landscape, in which each lesson
of the Bible will take its place.</p>

<p>(c) Its Geographical Background. The Bible
brings before us a world of natural features which
remain&mdash;seas, mountains, valleys, and plains; a
world of political divisions which has passed away;
its empires, kingdoms, and tribal relations; and
cities and towns, some of them now desolate,
others in poverty and in ruin. The teacher who
is to instruct his pupils must be able to see those
abiding elements, and by the aid of his historical
imagination to reconstruct those that have changed.
He must make that ancient world of the Bible
roll like a panorama before the eyes of his mind.</p>

<p>(d) Its Institutions. Upon every page of the
Bible are stamped pictures of manners, customs,
institutions, forms of worship, that are unfamiliar
to our Christian, Anglo-Saxon, modern world. The
teacher must become familiar with this local color
of another civilization, and enable his class to see
it through his eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>(e) Its Ethical and Religious Teaching. In the
past, and until a generation ago, the Bible was
studied only for its doctrines. It was generally
treated as one book, all written at once and by
one author; its history, biography, institutions,
were passed over as unimportant; while every
sentence was searched for some light upon theology.
From the Bible, by assorting and grouping its
texts out of every book, a system of doctrine was
constructed; and the mastery of this system with
its proof-texts was regarded as the principal work
of the Bible student. That method of Bible study
has justly fallen into disuse among modern
scholars. The Bible is now looked upon as a record
of life rather than as a treasury of texts. Yet its
stream of ethical, religious, and spiritual teaching
must be found and followed by the student who
is to teach the truth; and the doctrines revealed
through the Bible should be regarded as a necessary
part of his training.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Scholar.</i> One book must be studied
closely by the teacher, and that is his pupils.
During the last thirty years human nature in all
its stages, as child, as youth, during adolescence,
and in maturity&mdash;especially in the earlier periods&mdash;has
been investigated as never before. The student
in our time can enter into the results of special
study upon these subjects. He needs to know
what the best books can give him of child study
and mind study; and to supplement book-knowledge
in this department with watchful eyes and
close thought upon the traits which he finds in
his own scholars.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The School.</i> The teacher in the Sunday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
school needs to understand the institution wherein
he is a worker. The Sunday school is like the
week-day school, yet unlike it; and the teacher
must be able to appreciate at once what he can
follow and what he should avoid in the methods
of the secular school. The history of the Sunday-school
movement, its fundamental principles, its
organization, officers, methods of management, and
aims&mdash;all these are in the scope of the teacher's
preparation.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Work.</i> Whether on Sunday or on
Monday, a teacher is after all a teacher, and
the laws of true teaching are the same in a
Sunday school, in a public school, and in a
college. The application of those laws may
vary according to the ages of pupils, the subjects
of instruction, and the aims of the institution,
but the principles are unchanging. Those
enduring principles of instruction are well understood,
are set down in text-books, and can
easily be learned by a student. There are successful
teachers who know these principles by an
intuition that they cannot explain; but most people
will save themselves from many mistakes and
comparative failure by a close study of modern
educational methods.</p>

<p>In some way knowledge in all these four great
departments of training should be obtained by the
teacher, if possible, before he enters upon his task;
but if he has missed earlier opportunities of
preparation he must acquire this knowledge even
while he is teaching. The outlines of such a course
of study should be given in the training class for
young people; and such a training class should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
regarded as essential to every well-organized
school.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>2. <b>The Teacher's Task.</b> All the preparation
briefly outlined in these last paragraphs is only
preparatory to the work which the teacher is to
do in his vocation. The task set before the teacher
is fourfold:</p>

<p>(1) <i>As a Student.</i> The studies named above are
not completed when the teacher has passed out
of the training class with a certificate of graduation.
The public-school teacher who ceases to
study after finishing the course of the normal
school is foredoomed to failure. The training class
or the training school has only outlined before the
teacher the fields to be traversed, and shown him
a few paths which he may follow. He who has
undertaken to teach a group of scholars, whether
in the Beginners Department, the Senior Department,
or any grade between them, must continue
his studies, in the Bible, in the specific course of
graded lessons which he is teaching, and in general
knowledge; for there is no department of thought
or action which will not bring tribute to the
teacher, to be turned into treasure for his class.
The Sunday-school teacher must ever maintain an
open mind, a quick eye, and a spirit eager for
knowledge. His accumulation will prove a store
upon which to draw for teaching; and even that
unused will give its weight to truth imparted to
his class.</p>

<p>(<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1'">2</ins> ) <i>As a Friend.</i> The teacher is more than a
student dealing with books; he is a living soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in contact with living souls. If the most masterly
lesson teaching in the realm of thought could be
spoken into a phonograph, and then ground out
before a class, it would fail to teach, for it would
utterly lack the human element. Knowledge
counts for much in teaching, but personality counts
for far more. If a teacher is to be successful he
must have a close relationship with his class. They
must know him, he must know them, and there
must be a common interest, nay, a common
affection, between the two personalities of teacher
and pupil. He must be a friend to each one of
his scholars, schooling himself, if need be, to friendship;
and each of his scholars must be made to
realize that his teacher is his friend. This personal
affection need not always be stated in words. The
teacher who constantly assures his scholars that he
loves them will not be believed as readily as the
one who shows his love in his spirit and his acts,
even though he may refrain from affectionate
forms of speech.</p>

<p>(3) <i>As a Teacher.</i> Teaching requires more than
the possession of an abundant store of information
upon any subject. He is not a teacher who simply
pours forth upon the ears of his pupils an undigested
mass of facts, however valuable those facts
may be. The true teacher after large preparation
assorts his material, and selects such matter as is
appropriate to his own class. This he arranges
in a form to be readily received, thoroughly comprehended,
and easily remembered. He comes before
his class with the fixed purpose that every
pupil shall carry away with him a knowledge of
the lesson, and shall not forget it. He must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
awaken the pupil's attention; for talking to an
inattentive group of people accomplishes no more
than preaching to tombstones in a graveyard. He
must obtain the co&ouml;peration of the pupil's interest,
and induce him to think upon the subject. He
must call forth from his pupil some expression of
his thought in language, for one is never sure of
his knowledge until he has shaped it into words;
and that which the pupil has stated he is much
surer to remember than that which he has merely
heard. Teaching, then, involves (1) selection of
material, (2) adaptation of material, (3) presentation
of truth, (4) awakening thought, (5) calling
forth expression, (6) fixing knowledge in the
memory.</p>

<p>(4) <i>As a Disciple.</i> It is the teacher's task not
only to impart to his scholars valuable information
about the Bible, about God, about Christ, and
about salvation; but, far more than imparting an
intellectual knowledge, to bring the living word
into relation with living souls, to inspire a fellowship
of his pupils with God, to have Christ founded
within them, to make salvation through Christ
their joyous possession. Nor is his work as a
working disciple accomplished when all his scholars
have become Christians in possession and profession,
and members of Christ's Church. By his
example and his teachings he should lead them
to efficient service for Christ in the church, in
the community, and in the state. There is work
for every member in the church, and work for
everyone possessing the spirit of Christ in the
community. Whatever may have been the type
of a saint in the twelfth century, or in the sixteenth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
or even in the early nineteenth century, in
these stirring, strenuous years of the twentieth
century the disciple of Christ is a man among
men or a woman among women, active in the
effort to make the world better, and to establish
in his own village, or town, or ward of the city,
the kingdom of heaven on earth. To inspire his
scholars for such labors, and to lead them, is the
supreme opportunity and work of the teacher.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CONSTITUENCY OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>1. <b>Relation to the Community.</b> The Sunday
school is a temple built of living stones; and the
quarry from which they are taken in the rough,
to be cut and polished for their places in the
building, is the entire community in which the
school is placed. In our time, more than ever
before, the reasons are imperative why special
study should be given to the community from
which the school must draw its members. Certain
principles of administration will become apparent
when once the field is carefully considered.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Constituency Adjacent.</i> The population from
which a given Sunday school draws its members
must be generally that immediately around it.
Some teachers and scholars may come from a
distance, but even in this age of convenient transit
by trains and trolley cars, it is found that, taking
the church building as a center, the constituency
of the Sunday school in a city is mostly within a
radius of half a mile, and in the country within
a mile. Throughout that sphere of influence the
church should look well to the population, should
know its proportionate elements, as far as possible
should come into acquaintance with the families,
and should plan to win, to evangelize, and to hold
all its natural following.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Membership Representative.</i> Upon general
and almost invariable principles, the Sunday school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
should represent all the elements of the population
within its environment. If it be a residence section
with isolated houses, each containing but one
family of well-to-do people, the church is apt to
be a family church, and a large Sunday school
must not be looked for, since large mansions rarely
contain large families. If, on the other hand,
the neighborhood be populous, characterized by
varied strata of society&mdash;a few rich, a goodly
number fairly prosperous, and a greater mass of
wage-earners, yet the section as a whole American
and not foreign in its civilization&mdash;then a flourishing,
active, and growing Sunday school should be
expected. And it should embrace all these elements,
the rich, the middle class, and the wage-earners,
in the proportion which each bears to
the community as a whole. If the school in such
a population be small, or if it be composed exclusively
of one class, whether it be the so-called
better class or the mission class, there is a serious
error in its policy. The true Sunday school should
be representative of all the elements in the population.
It is both a crime and a blunder to limit
the efforts of a Sunday school to one class of
society: a crime, because such a school leaves
multitudes around it to perish; and a blunder,
because the effort results in an an&aelig;mic, dwindling,
dying institution.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Methods Adapted.</i> Almost every community,
whether in city or in country, possesses some
traits peculiar to itself. There may be two towns
ten miles apart, one the wealthy residential suburb
of a city, the other a settlement surrounding a
great factory. The population of these two places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
will be in marked contrast, and the methods of
Christian work successful in one will utterly fail in
the other. One street or avenue in a city may
mark the boundary line between family churches
and mission churches. Within ten minutes' walk
of each other may stand two churches of the same
denomination, yet so utterly apart in spirit as to
possess nothing in common but name. It is
possible that each of these two organizations might
learn something from the other, and might do
their Master's work better by a closer community
of interest and feeling. Yet it would be a mistake
to introduce into either church all the plans
that are successful in the other; or to reject in
one Sunday school any method because it has
proved a failure in another and a different field.
The work of each church and Sunday school must
be adapted to the population from which its
membership is to be drawn.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Changing Population.</b> One of the most
imperative questions confronting the gospel worker,
both in the church and the Sunday school, arises
from the constant changes taking place in our
population. In the cities we see stately churches,
once thronged, now well-nigh desolate, while their
walls echo to the tread upon the sidewalk of a
churchless multitude. In front of a fine old
church, where once millionaires worshiped, the
writer has often passed a news-stand upon which
are for sale newspapers in seven different languages.
And too often one finds that the churches
of a generation ago have been turned into low
theaters, or torn down, giving place to stores and
office buildings. The general principle may be laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
down, that a church in the city almost never lives
more than one generation in the same building
and with the same character. After thirty years
as the very longest period, if it is to retain its
members, it must follow them in the march up-town;
or if it is to retain its location and still
hold a congregation it must seek an absolutely
new constituency, and to this end must transform
its methods of work. Nor are these migrations of
population confined to the city. The towns and
villages are governed by the same law of change.
A village, once the seat of quiet homes, is suddenly
turned into a factory town, with a new and strange
population. The farms on country roads, abandoned
by the families that formerly tilled them,
are occupied by foreigners of alien speech and
manners. The building of a railroad will open
new towns, and at the same time will make more
than one deserted village. These changes in
population must be considered in their relation to
the work of the Sunday school. The movement
will be characterized by varied traits in different
places.</p>

<p>(1) <i>A Growing Population.</i> The change may be
that of a healthy growth in population, making
the community a desirable place for a church and
a Sunday school. Such a development is constantly
taking place in the newer portions of a city,
whose population is moving from the center to
the rim; or it may be noted in suburban towns,
as facilities of transportation bring new residents
from the metropolis; or it may appear in villages
springing up on the line of a railroad, where home-seekers
are settling and building habitations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Leaders in church and Sunday-school work must
watch these growing centers, and provide wisely
for their religious needs. It will not suffice to
wait for these newcomers to build their own
churches and organize their own Sunday schools.
Most of them are taxed to the utmost in building
or buying their own homes, and will scarcely
realize their need until the habit of neglecting
worship has become fixed, and their children grow
up without religious education. The old and strong
churches must extend a hand to the settlers, must
pre&euml;mpt church sites at the very beginning, must
help to erect chapels, for a time must supply
workers, and must set the current of the new
settlement Godward and churchward. The reward
of their labor and their liberality will not long be
delayed.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A Declining Population.</i> There are places
where the population has lessened, making the
work of the Sunday school increasingly difficult and
its results meager. It may be in the city, where
business has crowded away the dwellers of other
years, as in the lower end of Manhattan Island
in New York. There tall office buildings and
warehouses stand on sites formerly occupied by
churches, but no longer needed, now that almost
the only residents are the janitors and their
families, living on the roofs of the towerlike
temples of trade. But oftener the region of the
declining population is found in the country.
Villages once prosperous have gradually lost
their inhabitants. In places where three or four
churches, each with its Sunday school, were formerly
well supported, there is now scarcely a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
constituency for one. Yet all these churches,
though decayed and dying by inches, are still
maintained; and each church still houses a discouraged
Sunday school, attended by a faithful
few, but with no hope of growth and an imminent
peril of extinction. If loyalty to a denomination
could give way to love for the kingdom of Christ,
these might be consolidated into one church and
one Sunday school for all the community. We
venture the prophecy that before the twentieth
century comes to its close this will be throughout
the American continent the accepted settlement of
the question. May its fulfillment be not long
delayed! In the meantime these decayed but
still enduring Sunday schools and churches in a
community should seek for peace and friendship,
not emphasizing the points of doctrine or of
system that differ, but those that agree, and
striving to maintain the unity of the spirit in a
bond of love.</p>

<p>(3) <i>A Population Changing Socially.</i> A serious
problem often arises, not from a decline but from
a change in the social condition of the population
within the sphere of the church. The downtown
church may have been forsaken by its former
members, but people of another class, and in
greater numbers, have taken their places. The
mansions have become boarding houses, flats and
apartment houses have arisen, while the thronged
sidewalks, and the children playing in the streets,
are evidence that the material for members of the
church and the Sunday school is greater than
before. True, the new inhabitants are of a different
social order from the old, clerks and porters instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of merchants, employees instead of employers,
working people in place of the leisure class. The
fact that the social level of the neighborhood may
be regarded by the worldly-minded as lower than
formerly does not lessen its need of the gospel,
nor render it less promising for Christian work.
The church should look upon its field with unprejudiced
eyes, should have an understanding of the
time; should be alert to see and to seize its opportunity;
and should change its methods with its
changed constituency. The field must not be
abandoned; it must be cultivated, and new forms
of tillage will bring forth abundant harvests.</p>

<p>(4) <i>An Alien Population.</i> The most perplexing
of all social problems arises when immigration has
swept into the district surrounding the church a
tide of people whose birth and speech are foreign,
supplanting and in large measure driving out the
native population. There are sections in our cities
where the signs on the stores are all Bohemian,
or Polish, or Yiddish; where an English-speaking
church would remain absolutely empty, though
thousands throng the streets. It may be that in
such conditions gospel work under American
methods can no longer be maintained; and a
removal may be necessary. But even in the most
unpromising fields this conclusion should not be
hastily reached. We spend large sums in sending
missionaries to the lands from which some strangers
come; should we not embrace opportunities of
evangelizing these at our own door? There are
difficulties, but they are not nearly as insuperable
as those in foreign fields. These foreign-born or
foreign-descended children sit beside our own in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the public school; should we shut them out from
our Sunday schools? In less than a generation
millions of these boys and girls will be as thoroughly
American as our own children. When we consider
the question of abandoning any field on account of
its foreign population, let us widen our horizon of
thought to embrace the future as well as the
present, and then form our conclusion concerning
the duty of the Sunday school to the community.</p>

<p>3. <b>Practical Suggestions.</b> A few hints, some of
them already given, may summarize the practical
side of the subject:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Study the Field.</i> The Sunday school must
live not in the past, but in the present, with a
clear vision of the future. It must not only
cherish a loving memory of its field as it has been,
but understand thoroughly what it is, and what
forces are shaping it for the future. The leaders
in each Sunday school working for itself, or preferably
those conducting the Sunday schools of a
neighborhood working unitedly, should ascertain
the nationality, religious condition, and church
relations of every family in the district; and not
only of every family, of every individual who may
have a room in a boarding house. Each political
organization knows the residence and party proclivities
of every voter in the district; and the
churches may learn from the politicians practical
lessons upon the best methods of work.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Cultivate the Field.</i> Since the scholars must
come to the school from the population around it,
they should be sought, brought in, taught, and
evangelized, with all the energy and wisdom which
the church possesses. And not only the scholars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
but also, in large degree, the teachers must be
home-born and home-taught; therefore the Sunday
school, to be successful, must train up workers
from its own constituency.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Provide for all Elements.</i> By diligent and
constant effort the school should be made representative
of all ages, of all classes, of all sections,
and as far as practicable of all races found in its
community.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Adapt Methods.</i> If a former constituency
has removed from the field, and a new population
has surged in, the new element must be looked
upon as the constituency of the school. Its needs
must be recognized, however different they may be
from the needs of the past; and plans must be
formed to meet those needs, whatever transformation
of the school the new plans may involve.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RECRUITING THE SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>1. <b>Necessity.</b> The aspiration for advancement is
natural and noble; and therefore every member of
the Sunday school who is interested in its welfare,
whether officer, teacher, or pupil, desires it to
increase in membership, and to spread its benefits
as widely as possible. But the recruiting of the
Sunday school is not only desirable, but necessary.
It is found that in every school there exists an
outflow as well as an inflow of members. If in
certain departments, as the Primary, new scholars
are constantly enrolled, in other departments, as
the older grades of the Intermediate and the
Senior, there is as constant a dropping out of
members from the school. It has been estimated
that in most Sunday schools from twenty to
twenty-five per cent of the membership changes
annually, so that the average period of a teacher
or scholar in the Sunday school is less than five
years. There are some who remain longer, but
others who are members for even a shorter time.
Upon the average, every school is a new school
once in four or five years. If one fifth of the
school leaves every year, there must be an equal
number enter it, to keep the school at its normal
size. But any institution dependent upon the
maintenance of a constituency, whether it be a
periodical, a life-insurance association, or a Sunday
school, begins to decline when its number remains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
stationary. The health and life of the school,
therefore, require a constant renewal of its membership.
The school must have new blood, or it
will soon be impoverished and in time die.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Losses from the School.</b> Before the
presentation of plans for winning new scholars
comes the vital question of holding the scholars
already on the roll; for the condition of leakage
has a close relation to growth or decline. If the
causes of the leakage can be ascertained, and the
drain can be stopped, we shall be materially aided
in our effort to enlarge the school.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Search in the School.</i> Careful notation
should be kept of the grades from which scholars
are lost, or which are below a normal membership;
and equally careful inquiry should be made as
to the cause of the decline, and methods to correct
it should be sought. Is it in the Primary Department,
which should be the most rapidly growing
department in the school? Is it in the Junior or
Intermediate Department, where there ought to be
a steady increase, even if it be slow? Is it in the
Senior Department? Here there is great danger
of losses, especially among young men. Is it not
possible to find why they leave the school, and
what will induce them to remain? Perhaps the
school is deficient in the Adult Department. Must
it be admitted that the Sunday school is for children
only, and that as soon as its members become
men and women their departure from the school
is to be expected? The investigation should be
more than general, ascertaining what departments
are suffering loss; it should be personal, including
the name and grade of every scholar who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ceased to attend for a definite period; and as far
as possible the reason for his leaving the school.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Following up Absentees.</i> A systematic plan
for watching over the membership of the school
should be instituted and vigorously maintained.
For example, in some schools a report of every
absentee is made by the secretary to the superintendent.
On Monday morning each teacher receives
by mail the list of his absent scholars, with
a request to send in writing, as soon as practicable,
the cause of absence for each one. In many schools
this work of looking after the absentees is performed
by paid visitors&mdash;a good plan, but not so
good as for the teacher to come into personal
touch with his own scholars. A business firm
watches over its customers, and endeavors in
every possible way to hold them. The Sunday
school which can maintain its grasp upon its
members has the problem of growth already half
solved.</p>

<p>3. <b>Characteristics of a Growing School.</b> The
strongest force in recruiting the Sunday school is
to be found in the character of the school itself.
The merchant must have his shelves stocked with
attractive goods if he expects customers. In order
to obtain scholars there must be a good school.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Efficient.</i> The school should maintain high
educational standards; should be thoroughly graded
in all its departments, with suitable lessons for
each grade; and should have organized classes for
young people and adults. The thoroughly good
school will rarely lack for scholars.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Attractive.</i> The school should be attractive
as well as efficient. Its meeting place should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
cheerful and airy, with suitable furniture and
apparatus, above ground, and not a damp, dingy
basement. It should have enjoyable exercises, like
a school, yet not too severely like a public school.
It should greet new members heartily, make them
feel at home, and cultivate acquaintance with them.
There should be an animating spirit of loyalty and
love for the school; a devotion which will inspire
active effort in its behalf. Around the school
should be the atmosphere of a happy home.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Prominent.</i> Among the activities of the
church the school should stand forth prominently.
It should be kept in mind that, as the neighborhood
furnishes the constituency of the school, so
the school furnishes the members for the church.
In our time three fourths of the accessions by
profession of faith come from the Sunday school.
The school should be held in honor as the principal
source of supply to the church membership. If the
audience room is large and imposing, and the
Sunday-school room is inferior and unattractive; if
the pulpit and the choir are amply supported while
the school receives a narrow sustenance, however
great the prosperity of the church its duration will
be brief. The Sunday school must stand in the
foreground, and not in the background, if the
church is to grow; and the growing church should
have a growing Sunday school.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Special Occasions.</i> Throughout the Sunday-school
year occur days which should be recognized,
as breaking the monotony of the regular exercises,
and as attractive features of the school. Such are
Christmas, Easter, Children's Day in June, Rally
Day in the fall, and Decision Day, when the net<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is drawn for discipleship in behalf of the church.
Some superintendents look upon these occasions as
burdensome, but with careful preparation and an
attractive program they will add to the interest of
the school, while in no wise detracting from the
efficiency of its educational work. An occasional
social entertainment for the school, or for each
department in turn, and an outing day in the
summer, will strengthen that <i>esprit de corps</i> or
animating spirit of the school which is its strongest
drawing power in attracting new members.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Special Helps.</i> There are communities where
certain methods may avail more than elsewhere.
A well-conducted Sunday-school library, no longer
needed in many places, may be of great value in
villages where there is no public library. A reading
room, social hall, and gymnasium may constitute
the church a home for young men whose dwelling
places may be in close tenement houses. Young
men are in saloons, and young women are in
amusement parks, who might spend their evenings
under the healthy influence of the church if places
were provided. These plans and other features of
the institutional church will need careful and wise
administration if they are to do good and not
harm; but in many places they will minister to
the success of the school and the church, and also
to the uplifting of the community.</p>

<p>4. <b>Reaching Beyond the School.</b> Thus far in this
chapter we have considered the school rather than
the field. One of the chief tasks of the Sunday
school, however, is to reach out and lay hold of
all the inhabitants, both young and old, in the
area of its influence. The following active measures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have proved effective in reaching the people and
winning them to the school.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Advertise.</i> The school should be kept before
the community in every legitimate way. Merchants
tell us that the secret of success is first
to have salable goods, and then to advertise them;
and the same principle applies to the Sunday
school. Printer's ink should be used liberally, but
wisely. Only neatly printed, attractive matter
should be employed. Invitation cards, leaflets,
programs of special services, a little periodical
devoted to the school, a year book containing the
school register, and many other forms of advertisement
will help to inform the neighborhood that
the school is at work and is ready to welcome
new members.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Invite.</i> Every officer, teacher, scholar, and
parent should consider himself a committee to
speak to others about the school, and to invite
his friends and acquaintances to attend it. The
little children should ask their playmates, boys and
girls in school their classmates, young men their
shopmates, young women their associates. No
printed paper can have a tenth of the power
possessed by the living voice and a hearty hand-shake.
It is assumed that the invitation is given
only to those who are not already attached to any
church or school. All possible care should be
taken to maintain a fraternal spirit, and not to
build up our own wall by pulling down another.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Visit.</i> The field belonging to the school
should be bounded definitely, and should be thoroughly
and systematically canvassed. It should be
divided into districts, and each district assigned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to a visitor and a committee, who should know
who may be included in the proper constituency of
the school. For this work many schools and
churches employ a paid visitor or a deaconess; and
none can surpass the zeal or fidelity of many who
enter upon such a vocation. But the schools
which cannot afford professional workers include
some teachers and some adult scholars who can
give a portion of their own time to the same
task. An organized class of men might be named
which grew into over a hundred members through
persistent work by a simple plan. A lookout
committee, after careful inquiry, would report the
names and addresses of men eligible for membership.
Then the members in order and by appointment,
in groups of two, called upon each candidate,
formed his acquaintance, and invited him to the
class. Sometimes thirty or forty men would call,
but in time almost every man visited yielded to
the friendly social influence, became a member,
and soon after a worker for the class.</p>

<p>5. <b>A Danger.</b> A caution may be needed with
reference to all these plans of recruiting the school.
Advertising may be carried to the excess of becoming
sensational. Invitations may be pressed upon
scholars in other schools. The effort for increase
may degenerate into unfriendly rivalry. A good
plan may work evil when worked in a selfish spirit.
And a too-rapid growth is sure to be unhealthy.
The late B. F. Jacobs said, "God pity the Sunday
school that gets a hundred scholars at one time!"
A quiet, steady, diligent, persistent effort for the
school will be of permanent benefit, rather than a
spasm of enthusiasm.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TESTS OF A GOOD SUNDAY SCHOOL</div>


<p>In the United States more than a hundred
thousand Sunday schools are in session every week.
Some of them are very good, many are only
moderately efficient, and some are poor in every
respect. The question arises, what constitutes a
good Sunday school? Is it possible to establish
some standard of measurement by which the rank
of any Sunday school can be fixed? In such a
standard there must be several factors, for the
points of excellence in Sunday school are not one,
but many. It is the aim in this closing chapter
to ascertain the criteria or the tests of a good
Sunday school. The statement of these tests involves
the summing up and in some measure the
repetition of much already given throughout these
pages.</p>

<p>1. <b>Representative Character.</b> The first test of a
Sunday school is found in its relation to the
community around it. The Sunday school is not a
bed of exotic plants, dug up from their native soil,
potted and protected in a conservatory. It is an
outdoor garden wherein are cultivated the flowers
and fruits that are indigenous to the region. A
true Sunday school is a group of people drawn out
of the larger world around it, and representing
every element in that world, both as regards social
life and age. If it represents the rich and the
prosperous only, it is not a good school, unless the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
neighborhood is unfortunate in containing only
such people. If it is a mission school for poor
people in the midst of a self-supporting population,
it is not a good school. If it includes few members
above sixteen, and none above twenty-five years
of age, it is not a good school, for it should embrace
all ages from the infant to the grandfather. The
school which is to stand on the roll of honor is
one that fairly represents its constituency.</p>

<p>2. <b>Organization.</b> Another requirement for a good
school is that it be well organized as a graded
school. There may be Sunday schools which make
up by their spirit for what they lack in system;
yet the exceptions are few to the rule that in
Sunday-school work organization is essential to
success. It is true that machinery creates no
power; there is nothing in a constitution and by-laws
to make an institution successful. It is the
efforts of living men and women that bring to
pass results. But organization directs and economizes
power; so that, other elements being equal,
the graded school quickly becomes the best school.
We have already seen that a graded school is one
with departments defined, with the number of
classes in each department fixed according to the
needs of the school, with promotions at regular
periods, based either on age or examination or
merit, or on all three factors in combination, with
lessons graded according to the departments, and,
as its most important element, with a change of
teachers when the pupil is promoted from a lower
to a higher grade or department. The graded
system is not easy to establish; it requires firmness
and tact in the authorities, and a self-denying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
spirit on the part of teachers; but it will abundantly
and quickly repay all it costs in effort and sacrifice,
and it is an essential in a really good Sunday school.</p>

<p>3. <b>Order.</b> A good school is orderly, yet it is
not too orderly. Everybody is in place at the
proper time. At the minute, and not a minute
later, the superintendent opens the school. If he
rings a bell, it is a gentle, musical one, held up by
the leader as a signal and scarcely sounded. There
is not more confusion than at the opening of any
other religious service. Only one service is conducted
at a time; singing is worshipful, just as well
as prayer, and the Scriptures are read thoughtfully
and reverently. No officers are rushing up and
down the aisles during the services; no loud calls
are made for order; yet there is a suitable quietness
when quietness is desirable. A good school is
never disorderly, yet it cannot be said that the
best school is always the most orderly. Occasionally
one sees a Sunday school where order has
gone to the extreme of repressing all enthusiasm,
where the program is too finely cut and too thoroughly
dried, where the mechanism moves with the
precision of the lockstep in a state prison. The
ideal of the Sunday school is not that of the French
minister of education who is reported to have
stated that he could look at his watch and tell at
that minute what question was before each class
in every school in France!</p>

<p>4. <b>Spirit.</b> For lack of a more definite term we
call the next characteristic of a good Sunday
school its spirit. In any successful school one feels
rather than finds a peculiar and individual atmosphere.
Every member, from the superintendent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the Primary scholar, manifests an interest in the
institution; an interest of blended love, loyalty,
enjoyment in it and enthusiasm for it. There is
a social spirit in each class and in the school as a
whole. Its members do not meet as passengers in
a railway station, each one wrapped up in his own
business and watching for his own train. They
all have their individual friendships and social
relations, yet a bond unites them all as members
of one Sunday school. This peculiar <i>esprit de corps</i>,
an interest in the institution, is a strongly marked
feature in every progressive Sunday school.</p>

<p>5. <b>Educational Efficiency.</b> The Sunday school is
in the world with a definite work&mdash;religious education.
Its religion will be based on the Old Testament
and kindred literature in a Jewish school;
it will be based on both the Old and New Testament
and supplemental literature in a Christian school;
but whether Jewish or Christian, its work is the
teaching of religion, as contained in the living
Word, and illustrated by the lives and teachings
of the heroes of the faith. The true test of a Sunday
school is the answer that it can give to the question,
"Does it teach the vital religious truths of the
race so as to develop individual character and
efficiency?" That is its task, and by its success
in accomplishing it each school is to be judged;
not by the splendor of its building, or the exactness
of its machinery, or the enthusiasm of its members.
The thirty or thirty-five minutes devoted to the
lesson is the supremely important period in every
true Sunday school. The time is often bound to
be all too short for teaching divine truth, and
printing it upon mind and memory so deeply that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
all the studies and pleasures of the six days between
the two Sundays will not cause the teaching
to fade. Yet the time is as long as the ordinary
teacher (or preacher) can hold attention to one
subject, and therefore in most classes it is sufficient.
Toward that half hour of teaching, therefore,
all the energies of the school, of the training class,
home study, teachers' meeting, gradation, government,
should be turned. For the vital aim of the
Sunday school is the eternal message of God to
men through men, so that men and women of the
Christ spirit and character may be developed.</p>

<p>6. <b>Character-Building.</b> The first task, therefore,
of the Sunday school is to teach the Word, but that
teaching is only a means to an end, and that end
is greater than mere intellectual knowledge&mdash;it is
the building up of a complete character. This is
more than "bringing souls to Christ," or leading
them into church membership. If the sole aim
of the Sunday school was to compass the salvation
of the scholar and to surround him with the walls
of a church, then we might safely dismiss our
scholars when they have passed through a crisis
of conversion and entered the church door. But
the Sunday school is to do more than save its
scholars from sin. It is to train them in the
completeness of a Christian character; and such a
character involves not only personal righteousness
but also service for God and humanity. Its aim
is not to take people apart out of the world, but
to set them in the world, equipped for work in
making the world a Christian world, and thereby
establishing on earth the kingdom of heaven. The
measure by which the Sunday school accomplishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
such a work as this, constitutes the final, crucial
test of its success.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that any one of these six
essentials of a good Sunday school stands supreme.
They do not march in Indian file; nor are they
to be set one against another in a comparison of
values. These traits of a complete Sunday school
should rather be regarded as one of the New
Testament writers describes the traits of a complete
character, in that familiar yet only half-understood
passage, "As in the harmony of a choral song,
blend with your faith the note of energy, and with
your energy the note of knowledge, and with your
knowledge the note of self-mastery,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> through all
the eight aspects of the Christian; so let these six
essential elements be combined to form that noble
institution, the ideal Sunday school.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
